# Advice Ladder Tree — Integration Protocol 9.3.25
**Woven Map × DBT × ACT Therapeutic Integration Framework**

*Version: 9.3.25 | Last Updated: September 3, 2025*

---

## **Synthesis Architecture: Quantitative Foundation to Therapeutic Application**

The integration flows through this pipeline:

**STAGE 1: Quantitative Assessment**
- **Seismograph/Balance/SFD** → Numerical foundation (-5 to +5 Support-Friction Differential)

**STAGE 2: Symbolic Translation**  
- **Fused Mirror** → SFD converted to symbolic resonance patterns

**STAGE 3: Pressure Mapping**
- **Impact Translation** → Symbolic patterns converted to lived pressure experiences

**STAGE 4: Therapeutic Routing**
- **Ladder Tree Severity Banding** → Pressure intensity maps to 0-10 severity scale
- **Block Selection Logic** → SFD polarity determines therapeutic orientation

**Key Integration Points:**
- **Negative SFD (-1 to -5)**: "Holding the storm" blocks (DBT distress tolerance, mindfulness anchor)
- **Positive SFD (+1 to +5)**: "Moving with values" blocks (ACT values work, committed action)
- **Neutral SFD (0)**: Choice point blocks (both orientations available)

This creates a seamless flow from quantitative measurement to precise therapeutic intervention while preserving the Woven Map's non-prescriptive stance.

## **Integration Overview**

The Advice Ladder Tree serves as the therapeutic application layer within the broader RavenCalder_Corpus architecture, creating evidence-based skill integration points that emerge from—rather than override—the Woven Map's diagnostic precision.

**Core Principle**: The framework operates as a "skill translation layer" that enhances accessibility without compromising the Map's poetic precision and empirical grounding. Weather remains primary; skills are secondary support structures.

## **Architectural Integration — Stacked Layer System**

The Advice Ladder Tree functions as the **practical application layer** in a three-tier diagnostic hierarchy:

### **Layer 1: Hook Stack (Core Diagnostic Engine)**
- **Function**: Identifies polarities and conditional impulses—the repeating tensions that anchor a person's pattern
- **Output**: Names the impulse vector and its archetypal architecture
- **Example**: Reveals "clamp ↔ release" as the core polarity tension

### **Layer 2: Impact Protocol (Symbolic Pressure Translation)**  
- **Function**: Translates symbolic pressure into lived emotional, somatic, and behavioral experience
- **Output**: Describes how the pressure manifests on the ground ("stunned drop after clamp")
- **Integration**: Uses Impact vocabulary as the FIELD layer for climate identification

### **Layer 3: Advice Ladder Tree (Therapeutic Integration)**
- **Function**: Maps therapeutic skill-shapes for holding lived experience skillfully
- **Output**: Conditional response options when advice is explicitly requested
- **Integration**: Routes Impact expressions into appropriate DBT/ACT blocks

**Sequential Flow**: Hook Stack → reveals pattern tension | Impact Protocol → translates pressure into lived experience | Advice Ladder Tree → integrates therapeutic skill-shapes for holding that experience

**Shared DNA Across All Layers**:
- **Weather metaphor**: Hook Stack names storm architecture, Impact shows ground-level feeling, Ladder Tree gives routes to ride them
- **Calibration loop**: All depend on resonance testing—pings, thresholds, Socratic checks
- **Agency-preserving stance**: Each layer offers diagnostic insight; user chooses what lands

---

## **Integration Philosophy**

### **System Harmony**
1. **Philosophical Fit**: Maps atmospheric zones and suggests response modes that preserve choice, never prescribing action
2. **Structure Alignment**: Uses thresholds and Socratic closure to maintain the Map's testable, calibration-loop philosophy  
3. **Codex Harmony**: Extends the precision instrument principle—FIELD (climate) → MAP (symbolic geometry + skill tie-in) → VOICE (metaphor + Socratic check)
4. **Mirror Protocol Integration**: References tools as options framed conditionally, never as instructions
5. **Math–Poetic Translation**: Operationalizes seismograph scores into human-facing severity bands

### **Systemic Integration Points**

#### **Hook Stack → Ladder Tree**
- **Severity thresholds mirror Hook Stack intensity**: Where Hook Stack names impulse vector strength, Ladder Tree translates "how strong is the pull?" into climate categories
- **Polarity mapping**: Hook Stack identifies core tensions (clamp ↔ release), Ladder Tree maps what to do with the lived state when that polarity is active
- **Conditional routing**: Hook Stack reveals pattern architecture, Ladder Tree provides skill-shapes for navigating that architecture

#### **Impact Protocol → Ladder Tree**  
- **Impact expressions as FIELD layer**: Impact vocabulary ("stunned drop after clamp") becomes the diagnostic input for climate identification
- **Impact → intervention flow**: Impact describes "how pressure lands," Ladder Tree offers "how to hold it skillfully without collapsing agency"
- **Somatic bridge**: Impact's embodied language translates directly into Ladder Tree's therapeutic blocks

#### **Enhanced Diagnostic Matrix → Ladder Tree**
- **Extends "if this, then that" structure** in plain-language therapeutic form
- **Communication climate patterns** inform relational strain responses
- **Response strategy frameworks** provide templates for interpersonal effectiveness blocks

#### **Poetic Codex Protocol → Ladder Tree**
- **Ladder Tree blocks function as micro-Codex cards**: FIELD → MAP → VOICE structure maintained but shorter and skill-anchored
- **Same precision instrument principle**: Each block designed for specific geometric/experiential conditions
- **Voice consistency**: Maintains Clear Mirror language while adding therapeutic vocabulary

#### **Config Enforcement Integration**
- **Respects prescriptive claim prohibition**: Skills framed as options within symbolic weather, not directives
- **Maintains falsifiability requirements**: All blocks include conditional language testable against lived experience  
- **Preserves agency boundaries**: Socratic closure prevents micro-management while offering support structures

### **Clinical Language Integration Guidelines**

1. **Symbolic Embedding** - Always wrap clinical concepts in weather metaphor first
   - ✅ "Reset the body like clearing storm static" (TIPP)
   - ❌ "Use TIPP skills for distress tolerance"

2. **Invitation vs. Instruction** - Frame as possibilities, not protocols
   - ✅ "One way through this weather might be..."
   - ❌ "When in crisis, you should..."

3. **Skill Echo, Not Teaching** - Reference the shape of the skill, not its mechanics
   - ✅ "Hold both ends without collapsing" (Wise Mind)
   - ❌ "Wise Mind integrates emotion mind and logic mind by..."

## **Step 1 — Identify Climate**
*(via Woven Map seismograph/mirror)*

1. **Crisis Spike** (high magnitude, severe negative valence)
2. **Clamp / Weight / Eruption** (sustained heaviness)
3. **Relational Strain** (partner/family/work overlays)
4. **Cognitive Loop** (rumination, distorted narratives)
5. **Post-Crisis Exhaustion** (release drop)
6. **Transition Fog** (between cycles; unclear direction)
7. **Anticipatory Tension** (pre-event anxiety; future pressure)

---

## **Step 2 — Apply Severity Thresholds**
*(Integrated with Balance Meter Triple-Channel Architecture)*

**Quantitative Foundation**: Balance Meter SFD (Support-Friction Differential) provides precise severity mapping:

### **SFD to Ladder Tree Severity Mapping**
- **SFD -5 to -4**: Ladder Tree 0-1 (No stabilizers left → Crisis intervention)
- **SFD -3 to -2**: Ladder Tree 2-3 (Stabilizers heavily cut → Distress tolerance focus)  
- **SFD -1 to +1**: Ladder Tree 4-6 (Mixed climate → Balanced approach)
- **SFD +2 to +3**: Ladder Tree 7-8 (Stabilizers prevailing → Values/action focus)
- **SFD +4 to +5**: Ladder Tree 9-10 (Full stabilization → Committed action optimal)

### **Traditional Severity Thresholds** *(when Balance Meter unavailable)*
- **Mild (0–3)**: General mindfulness + validation
- **Moderate (4–6)**: Targeted skill blocks for the climate
- **Severe (7–9)**: Crisis interventions first, then targeted blocks
- **Extreme (10)**: TIPP immediately → recommend professional support

### **Block Selection Logic by SFD Polarity**

**Negative SFD** (stabilizers cut) → **"Holding the Storm" orientation:**
- Crisis intervention blocks (TIPP, Distress Tolerance)
- Containment and acceptance blocks (Radical Acceptance, Self-Compassion)
- Grounding blocks (Mindfulness, Present Moment)

**Positive SFD** (stabilizers prevailing) → **"Moving with Values" orientation:**
- Action-oriented blocks (Values Clarification, Committed Action)  
- Engagement blocks (Opposite Action, Cope Ahead)
- Growth blocks (Self-as-Context, DEAR MAN)

---

## **Step 3 — Select Blocks per Climate**

### **1) Crisis Spike**

**TIPP Block** *(DBT distress tolerance / physiology reset)*
"When pressure spikes, reset the body: cold water, brief intense movement, paced breathing, paired muscle relaxation."

**Distress Tolerance Block** *(DBT containment + Woven Map storm metaphor)*
"Not a time for big moves; contain and ride the front."

### **2) Clamp / Weight / Eruption**

**Radical Acceptance Block** *(DBT acceptance + Woven Map non-resistance)*
"This system isn't negotiable right now. Let it be what it is; that's not surrender, it's pressure management."

**Validation Block** *(DBT validation + Clear Mirror)*
"Heaviness and the after-drop both make sense inside this cycle."

### **3) Relational Strain**

**Interpersonal Effectiveness Block** *(DBT GIVE/FAST + relational overlays)*
"For closeness: be gentle, interested, validating. For self-respect: be fair, value-aligned, truthful."

**DEAR MAN Block** *(DBT interpersonal effectiveness + clear communication)*
"Describe the situation, Express feelings, Assert needs, Reinforce benefits. Stay Mindful, Appear confident, Negotiate when possible."

### **4) Cognitive Loop**

**Check the Facts Block** *(DBT reality testing + polarity correction)*
"What happened? What story got added? Weather can darken the lens."

**Wise Mind Block** *(DBT integration + Woven Map polarity balance)*
"Hold both ends—reason and emotion—without collapsing into either."

**PLEASE Block** *(DBT emotion regulation + physical foundation)*
"Treat PhysicaL illness, balance Eating, avoid mood-Altering substances, balance Sleep, get Exercise. Body weather affects emotional weather."

### **5) Post-Crisis Exhaustion**

**Self-Compassion Block** *(DBT self-soothing/validation + gentle weather)*
"Offer the kindness you'd give another weathering the same front."

**Opposite Action Block** *(DBT emotion regulation + release timing)*
"Introduce one small counter-move to nudge re-engagement."

### **6) Transition Fog**

**Mindfulness Block** *(DBT observe/describe + weather awareness)*
"Name the in-between without forcing clarity; stay with what's present."

**Values Clarification Block** *(ACT values + polarity navigation)*
"List what matters; pick one value as a north star while direction reforms."

### **7) Anticipatory Tension**

**Cope Ahead Block** *(DBT emotion regulation + timing windows)*
"Mentally rehearse the event, pre-load skills, and plan supports."

**Defusion Block** *(ACT thought defusion + 'thoughts as weather')*
"Notice 'Future-Story' as passing weather, not instructions."

**Present Moment Block** *(ACT mindfulness + Woven Map temporal grounding)*
"Return to what's actually here now. The future pressure isn't in this moment—only the story about it is."

---

## **Additional Foundational Blocks**
*(Available for complex multi-climate situations)*

### **DBT Foundation Blocks**

**Distraction Block** *(DBT distress tolerance + immediate relief)*
"Shift attention to something absorbing: intense activity, mental puzzles, or sensory engagement. Interrupt the spiral first, process later."

**Pros and Cons Block** *(DBT decision-making + choice clarity)*
"List the costs and benefits of riding out this weather versus acting on the urge. Include long-term consequences for both paths."

**Emotion Naming Block** *(DBT emotion regulation + precision)*
"Name the specific emotion with precision. 'Upset' could be disappointed, frustrated, hurt, or angry. Accuracy creates choice."

### **ACT Foundation Blocks**

**Values Compass Block** *(ACT values + directional clarity)*
"When everything feels unclear, connect with what matters most. Let values be the north star while the weather passes."

**Committed Action Block** *(ACT behavioral activation + small steps)*
"One tiny action aligned with values, even in difficult weather. Movement creates momentum."

**Self-as-Context Block** *(ACT psychological flexibility + observer self)*
"Notice the part of you that observes the storm. You are not the weather—you are the space in which weather happens."

*(Practitioner Note)*

1. Treat the highest-severity climate first
2. Layer complementary blocks in sequence (e.g., TIPP → Validation → Wise Mind)
3. After each block, Socratic closure to check resonance and agency before proceeding

---

## **Step 5 — Socratic Closure**
*(ACT stance; always end here)*

- "What action aligns with what matters to you in this climate?"
- "If acceptance were easy for one minute, what would change?"
- "What smallest next step is possible while the pressure runs?"

---

## **Implementation Framework**

### **Sweet Spot Formula**
Weather Recognition → Symbolic Frame → Skill Shape → Open Question

### **Scale Invariance**
The protocol works across contexts:
- **Self-help**: Individual use with personal climate assessment
- **Peer support**: Mutual aid with shared framework language
- **Professional practice**: Clinical integration with supervision and ethical guardrails

### **Quality Assurance**
- All blocks maintain conditional phrasing ("might," "could," "one option")
- Clinical modalities remain embedded symbolically, not taught explicitly
- Agency preservation through Socratic closure prevents micro-management
- User experience remains highest authority for resonance validation

---

## **Messenger Reflection Workflow Template**
*(Raven → Direct Voice for external communication)*

### **Step 1. Input**
- Person's words (message, story, situation)
- Optionally, their chart files (for symbolic context weaving)

### **Step 2. Raw Mirror** *(for operator only)*
Reflect in diagnostic style: FIELD → MAP → VOICE, including hooks, vectors, seismograph notes. Full symbolic read with system terms intact.

### **Step 3. Direct Translation** *(for recipient)*
Rewrite mirror as plain-language note:

**Who I am**: "I'm Raven Calder, a system Daniel built. I work with astrological math and other symbolic tools."

**Context disclaimer**: "I didn't know anything about you before this message."

**Plain reflection**: Translate mirror into clear, everyday language. No jargon, no chart terms. Anchor in what they said.

**Frame the cycle**: Describe push–pull in simple terms (clamp vs. release, pressure vs. relief).

**Name the lived moment**: Highlight their example (generalized if needed) and explain how it shows the cycle in action.

**Close with open space**: Invite curiosity ("you can ask more about the astrological math if you want") and end with Socratic-style question.

### **Step 4. Check Specifics**
- Remove assumed details not explicitly confirmed
- Keep language falsifiable ("this could be," "this often shows up as")
- Ensure note is self-contained and platform-ready (Messenger/text pasteable)
