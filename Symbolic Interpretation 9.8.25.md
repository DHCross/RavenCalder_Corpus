# **The Woven Map: A Complete Framework for Symbolic Interpretation**

*Finalized: September 2025*

---

## I. Orientation

The Woven Map is a diagnostic symbolic system. Its purpose is to render astrology into falsifiable mirrors of lived experience—never predictions, never mandates. Geometry creates symbolic weather; the framework translates it into testable, conditional reflections.

This system rests on three foundations:

1. **Agency First.** Symbols describe possibility, not fate. Nothing in the chart *causes* events; tension simply creates climates where choices land differently.
2. **Falsifiability.** Every claim is testable in lived experience. If no recognition occurs, the output is logged as OSR (Outside Symbolic Range).
3. **Non-linear Time.** Pressure doesn’t unfold like a script but accumulates in loops, returns, and thresholds. Geometry signals probability fields, not timelines.

---

## II. System Architecture

The Woven Map runs on a **FIELD → MAP → VOICE** pipeline:

* **FIELD:** Raw geometry and energetic pressure windows (computed by Math Brain).
* **MAP:** Archetypal motifs, tension patterns, and polarity hooks (structured by Raven Calder).
* **VOICE:** Plain-language mirrors—conditional, body-grounded, testable.

Nothing passes to VOICE without anchoring in FIELD and MAP. Metaphor stays leashed to geometry for full auditability.

## III. Diagnostic Instruments

### 1. **The Hook Stack**

Recognition begins where tension is loudest. The hierarchy:
① Personal–outer hard aspects
② Angles
③ Anaretic (29°) planets
④ Anchor placements

Hooks mark the daily “hot spots” where tension is most felt. Each becomes a candidate for ping classification (WB / ABE / OSR).

### 2. **SST: Symbolic Spectrum Table**

Every resonance is logged as:

* **WB (Within Boundary):** clear recognition.
* **ABE (At Boundary Edge):** partial, inverted, or mis-toned recognition.
* **OSR (Outside Symbolic Range):** null data, valid absence.

No symbolic pattern counts as active without lived ping.

### 3. **Balance Meter**

The Balance Meter converts raw pressure into narrative climate. It integrates four channels:

1. **Seismograph:** Magnitude ⚡, Valence 🌞/🌑/🌗, Volatility 🌪️.
2. **Balance Channel:** Where scaffolding holds vs. cuts.
3. **Support–Friction Differential (SFD):** Net balance between stabilizers and strain.
4. **Resilience Layer:** Endurance, depletion, rebound potential.

All climate lines translate these measures into symbolic weather: “pressure bands,” “support or cut,” and “reserves and recovery.”

---

### 4. **Vector Architecture**

Vectors describe how structural tension is held, suppressed, or released. Silence never equals absence—latent, suppressed, or dormant vectors must still be mirrored.

* **Containment Shades:** constriction, grip, lock, compression, bind.
* **Release Shades:** expansion, unwinding, unlocking, lightening, unbinding.

Every Mirror names which shades are in play, which are blocked, and where balance is sought.

## IV. Mirror Templates

### Solo Mirror

* **Typological Profile:** dominant, secondary, and shadow functions, each linked to geometry.
* **Recognition Layer:** short vignettes of daily friction.
* **Balance Meter Weather:** seismograph + scaffolding + resilience, in plain language.
* **Vector Integrity Check:** latent/suppressed/dormant tensions flagged.
* **Polarity Cards:** FIELD → MAP → VOICE renderings of 2–3 core dyads.
* **Mirror Voice:** stitched reflection of the climate—conditional, body-grounded.

### Relational Mirror

Adds synastry hooks, bidirectional echo loops, and tier-specific gates. Reflections remain diagnostic, never prescriptive.

## V. Protocol Guardrails

* **Conditional Language Only.** Every line in E-Prime: may, might, could.
* **Recognition Required.** No geometry is “active” without ping.
* **Transparency.** Every metaphor traceable to source geometry.
* **Relocation Guardrails.** Houses/angles move under relocation; typology always remains natal. Suppress house claims if birth time confidence is low.

## VI. Operational Philosophy

The Woven Map is not prophecy. It is a mirror—a way of holding pressure so it can be seen, tested, and released. Each reading is a dialogue between geometry and recognition, never a verdict.

If resonance is felt, it counts. If not, OSR is logged. Null data is as valuable as confirmation, because it keeps the system honest.

---

## VII. Closing Note

The map is not the land. The symbols are not commands. What matters is whether the mirror speaks to lived experience. The Woven Map holds the tension between structure and choice—agency never leaves the subject’s hands.
