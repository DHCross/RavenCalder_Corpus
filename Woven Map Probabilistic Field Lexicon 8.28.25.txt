# **_Woven Map Probabilistic Field Lexicon_**

_This document outlines a method for navigating life's fields through a probabilistic lens, moving beyond traditional astrological domains to focus on lived qualities and states. It provides a lexicon of key terms and a framework for constructing scenario-mapping questions, all grounded in the principles of The Woven Map system._

### **_Core Lexicon_**

#### **_Agency_**

_Capacity to respond, recalibrate, or act within a resonance field. Always emergent, never guaranteed. Mapped as “supported,” “unsanctioned,” “latent,” or “under pressure.”_

#### **_Archetypal Field_**

_A pattern space defined by symbolic geometry (planetary, angular, etc.)—not “career,” “love,” etc.—but “a zone of resonance” with characteristic tensions, possibilities, and risks._

#### **_Boundary / Boundary Edge_**

_The limit of likely resonance as defined by the Symbolic Spectrum Table (SST). “Boundary” = inside the probable field; “boundary edge” = unusual but plausible; “outside range/OSR” = no meaningful resonance found._

#### **_Coherence Spike_**

_A marked, time-bound increase in resonance, agency, or clarity—often accompanied by a strong “ping.” Not always positive; sometimes brings paradox or sharp tension._

#### **_Field Logging_**

_The practice of regularly noting lived tension, openness, restriction, risk, or agency, in parallel with symbolic data. Used to correlate geometry with experience without enforcing causality._

#### **_Manifestation (Rejected)_**

_The idea that thoughts/desires “cause” outcomes. Explicitly denied in this system. Resonance fields may correlate with experience, but do not “create reality” on demand._

#### **_Openness_**

_A probabilistic window of lowered restriction and increased possibility. Not a guarantee—more like “increased ease of movement or connection” within a field._

#### **_Out-of-Symbolic-Range (OSR)_**

_A result or experience that falls outside the expected symbolic field, according to the SST. Logged as null data; valuable for model refinement._

#### **_Ping_**

_A felt, real-time recognition of meaningful coincidence or resonance. Must be lived and testable; not retro-fitted. Used as a validation signal, not as a directive._

#### **_Pressure Zone_**

_A phase or period marked by increased symbolic or emotional tension, as forecast by geometry. Implies increased vigilance, recalibration, or need for boundary-testing—not disaster._

#### **_Probabilistic Forecasting_**

_Mapping “structural likelihoods” of agency, restriction, openness, or risk based on chart geometry. Never a prediction; always a field of possibility with recognized boundaries._

#### **_Resonance Sphere / Resonance Field_**

_A dynamic, temporary “zone” where certain types of agency, risk, or pattern recognition are activated. Experience within it is mapped, not mandated._

#### **_Restriction_**

_Increased structural or emotional friction. Signals a need to recalibrate, retreat, or narrow focus. Not a prohibition, but a shift in the “ease” of agency._

#### **_Risk Archetype_**

_A pattern or field where agency becomes more vulnerable or unstable; not “danger” per se, but a spike in reactivity, impulsivity, or symbolic pressure._

#### **_Structural Tension_**

_Underlying pressure or strain in a resonance field—may be generative (creative friction) or destabilizing. Useful for tracking patterns over time._

#### **_Supported / Unsanctioned_**

_Describes whether agency is “in the flow” with the resonance field (“supported”), or likely to meet friction, reversal, or null results (“unsanctioned”)._

#### **_Visibility_**

_Degree to which agency, action, or need is recognized, mirrored, or echoed in the field. Sometimes marked by publicness, sometimes by social amplification._

### **_Adjective Table for Scenario Mapping_**

_(Woven Map Probabilistic Fields)_

_This table is designed to help generate questions and map scenarios about any area of life using a dual-axis approach: qualities/states as a framework for field-mapping. Each scenario demonstrates how these adjectives can combine, and what symbolic factors may shape those probabilities._

**_Adjective_**

**_Opposite/Range_**

**_Scenario/Question Example_**

**_Symbolic Factors_**

**_Openness_**

**_Restriction_**

_Where do I sense a window opening, and where is the field narrowing?_

_Jupiter/Saturn; House ingress_

**_Supported_**

**_Unsanctioned_**

_Is my agency buoyed or running against symbolic currents?_

_Trines/Squares, Dignities_

**_Visibility_**

**_Obscurity/Withdrawal_**

_Will my actions be recognized or remain unseen?_

_Sun, Ascendant, 10th house_

**_Expansion_**

**_Contraction/Retreat_**

_Is now a time for broad moves or conserving energy?_

_Jupiter, Saturn, 4th/12th H_

**_Agency_**

**_Powerlessness_**

_Where do I feel able to shape outcomes, and where am I blocked?_

_Mars, Pluto, MC, Out-of-Bounds_

**_Risk_**

**_Stability/Safety_**

_Where am I exposed to new challenges or likely to play it safe?_

_Uranus, Mars, Nodes_

**_Resonance_**

**_Dissonance_**

_Where do I sense “in tune” patterning vs. friction?_

_Venus, Saturn, chart aspects_

**_Connection_**

**_Isolation_**

_What are the odds for new alliances vs. increased solitude?_

_Venus, 7th/11th Houses_

**_Luck**<br>(Pattern Accumulation)_

**_Null**<br>(No pattern)_

_Is the field “ripe” for positive accumulation, or is it a signal void?_

_Part of Fortune, 5th House_

### **_Scenario Question Construction Examples_**

- **_Openness & Risk:_** _"Is the current field characterized by open opportunities, or do those opportunities carry increased risk of destabilization?"_
- **_Visibility & Agency:_** _"Where in my present sphere might agency lead to recognition, and where might it result in withdrawal or being overlooked?"_
- **_Expansion & Resonance:_** _"Am I in a cycle of natural expansion that feels ‘in tune’, or am I stretching into dissonant territory?"_
### **_How to Use the Table_**

1. _Select 2–3 adjectives most relevant to your current uncertainty or goal._
1. _Phrase a question using those adjectives, e.g., "What does the field suggest about agency and risk over the next week?"_
1. _Map symbolic geometry to those adjectives, referencing current transits, natal activations, or field log data._
1. _Interpret probabilistically:_
-- **_High resonance:_** _Supported, likely._
-- **_At boundary:_** _Possible, with tension._
-- **_OSR:_** _Not supported/likely._
