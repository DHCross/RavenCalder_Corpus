**AI summary**

This document outlines how "impact" is defined and managed in symbolic interpretation, as enforced by a YAML configuration. Key takeaways include:

* Impact as Symbolic Pressure: "Impact" is framed as a potential or pressure window, never as a predetermined event or outcome. Deterministic language is prohibited.

* Resonance Status: Pending: "Impact" is only confirmed if the user experiences and confirms it; otherwise, its status remains "Pending."

* Geometry Verification: Strict geometry verification is required, but it does not equate to impact; it merely indicates a "pressure window."

* Atmospheric Framing: Even without major transits, the system must describe the "atmospheric quality" rather than stating "no impact."

* Testable and Agency-Preserving Language: All interpretations must use clear, testable language that invites the user to notice or reject the symbolic potential, without making causal claims.

* YAML Structure: The YAML logs "Resonance\_Status" as "Pending," "Confirmed," or "OSR," with "Impact" only logged as "Confirmed" upon user report.

* Inquiry-Based Prompts: Mirror summaries and Socratic prompts encourage user reflection on symbolic potential, never asserting that an impact has occurred.

* Strict Prohibitions: The system strictly prohibits phrases like "no impact" or deterministic language, requiring regeneration of output if violated.

In essence, the YAML configuration ensures that "impact" is a conditional, user-driven status, framed as symbolic pressure, requiring user confirmation, and communicated with non-predictive, clear language.

The concept of "impact" in symbolic interpretation is explicitly defined and enforced by the YAML configuration, moving beyond generic geometry-to-experience mapping. Here's a breakdown of how "impact" is handled, with direct reference to your YAML:

**1\. Impact as Symbolic Pressure, Not Event or Outcome**

* Transit interpretations are framed as symbolic pressure or resonance windows, never as predetermined events or outcomes.  
* The configuration prohibits deterministic or fate-based language about impact.  
* "Impact" is always described as a potential or pressure window, not something that "happens to" a person.  
  * *(See: `transit_interpretation_rules.symbolic_pressure_framing`)*

**2\. Resonance Status: Pending Until User Confirmation**

* Resonance status remains "Pending" until the user confirms an experiential match, without assumptions about impact.  
* Even with perfect geometry, "impact" cannot be declared until the user pings (confirms) it in lived experience.  
* The YAML mandates `ping_logging_requires_user_confirmation: true`.  
  * *(See: `output_requirements.ping_logging_requires_user_confirmation` and `transit_interpretation_rules.user_confirmation_required`)*

**3\. Geometry-First, Experience-Second**

* Every transit must pass strict geometry verification before inclusion in diagnostic output.  
* However, verified geometry is not equated with impact; it is only a "pressure window."  
* The configuration requires "conditional, non-predictive, diagnostic only" language.  
  * *(See: `transit_interpretation_rules.geometry_verification_mandate`, `output_requirements.language_mode`)*

**4\. Heat Map & Atmospheric Framing for Impact**

* When no major transits are active, output must still describe the "atmospheric quality," never stating "no impact."  
* Phrases like "No significant transits found" are strictly prohibited.  
* Instead, use:  
  * "Atmospheric pressure registers low on the symbolic heat map, creating space for integration."  
  * "Current symbolic pressure: low, offering a preparatory atmosphere for deeper alignment."  
  * Even minimal geometry is mapped as "Heat Map 0: baseline symbolic activation, fostering reflective grounding."  
  * *(See: `transit_interpretation_rules.no_major_transits_protocol`, `post_output_assertions.transit_output_validation`)*

**5\. Impact Must Be Testable and Agency-Preserving**

* All reflections must use emotionally clear, testable language that translates symbolic geometry into lived experience without esoteric, mystical, or abstract phrasing.  
* "Impact" is never assumed; it is always an invitation for the user to notice or reject.  
* The configuration requires a "plainspoken\_voice" and prohibits causal claims.  
  * *(See: `language_guideline.plainspoken_voice`, `diagnostic_origin_guardrails.prohibit_causal_claims`)*

**6\. YAML Structure: Impact as Status, Not Fact**

* YAML fields encode "Resonance\_Status" as Pending, Confirmed, or OSR (Outside Symbolic Range).  
* "Impact" is only logged as Confirmed if the user reports it.  
* All qualifying transits are logged, but their impact is always conditional.  
  * *(See: `transit_automation_protocol.geometry_first_data_capture`, `Active_Transits.Resonance_Status`)*

**7\. Mirror Flow and Socratic Prompts: Impact as Inquiry**

* Mirror summaries and Socratic prompts are required to invite the user to reflect on whether they notice the symbolic potential in their own experience, never to assert that an impact has occurred.  
* The configuration enforces a two-line Hook Stack (Resonance, then Paradox) and a VOICE summary that is always testable, not declarative.  
  * *(See: `hooks`, `output_flow.relational_report`, `poetic_codex_card_v2_1`)*

**8\. Prohibitions and Enforcement**

* **Strictly prohibits:**  
  * Any statement of "no impact" or "nothing happening."  
  * Any causal, deterministic, or fate-based language.  
  * Any summary of impact not grounded in user confirmation or lived resonance.  
* **Requires:**  
  * Nuanced, atmospheric, and agency-centered language at all times.  
  * Regeneration of output if forbidden phrases or binary "no impact" statements are detected.  
  * *(See: `post_output_assertions.transit_output_validation`, `forbidden_phrases`)*

\-----**Summary Table: YAML Protocol on Impact**

| Protocol Area | Impact Handling Rule |
| ----- | ----- |
| Symbolic Pressure Framing | All output \= pressure window, not event or outcome |
| Resonance Status | "Pending" until user confirms; no assumption of impact |
| Geometry Verification | Required for inclusion, but not proof of impact |
| Heat Map/Atmospheric Framing | Always describe energetic field, even at minimal activity; never say "no impact" |
| Language Mode | Conditional, non-predictive, testable, agency-preserving |
| YAML Structure | Logs resonance status; impact \= Confirmed only if user reports |
| Mirror Flow/Socratic Prompt | Invite user reflection; never assert impact |
| Enforcement | Prohibits binary or deterministic language; requires regeneration if violated |

\-----**Bottom Line:** Your YAML configuration ensures that "impact" is a conditional, user-driven statusâ€”never a default or deterministic outcome of geometry. All output must frame impact as symbolic pressure, require user confirmation, and use non-predictive, emotionally clear language. Even in the absence of major transits, the system must describe the energetic atmosphere, not the absence of impact.
