# Balance Meter v5.0 — The Two-Axis Specification
---
**Date:** October 9, 2025
**Version:** 5.0
**Status:** ✅ ADOPTED

## 1. Executive Summary: Geometric Purity

**Raven's Directive:** *"The math must keep the poetry honest."*

This document specifies the v5.0 architecture of the Balance Meter, a two-axis symbolic seismograph. This version represents a return to first principles: every metric must be a direct translation of aspect geometry.

**v5.0 supersedes all previous multi-channel (v1.x, v4.0) architectures.** It removes all meta-derivatives (e.g., `Coherence`, `Volatility`), composite products (`SFD`), and complex feedback loops (`Resilience/Depletion`).

The system is reduced to two core public axes:
1.  **Magnitude (0–5):** How intense is the symbolic field?
2.  **Directional Bias (–5 to +5):** In which direction is the energy flowing (inward/outward)?

This simplification ensures every output is falsifiable, traceable, and directly grounded in the source geometry of planetary aspects.

## 2. The Two Core Axes (Public)

The Balance Meter is for **FIELD (transits) only**. It measures the symbolic "weather," not the constitutional "climate" of a natal chart.

| Axis | Range | What It Measures | Grounding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Magnitude ⚡** | 0–5 | Intensity of the symbolic field | `Σ(orbStrength × planetWeight × sensitivity)` |
| **Directional Bias ↗️↘️** | -5 to +5 | Net energy direction (inward/outward) | `Σ(orbStrength × polarity × planetWeight)` |

**Key Principles:**
*   **Directional, Not Moral:** Directional Bias is not a measure of "good" or "bad." Both poles can be adaptive or challenging depending on context.
*   **Traceability:** Every daily reading **must** include a `Trace` field listing the top 3-5 contributing aspects by weight, ensuring the "show-your-work" clause is met.
*   **Fixed Baseline Scaling:** All scores are scaled against a fixed, long-horizon baseline. This prevents month-long saturation artifacts where scores remain pegged at ±5.

## 3. Build Specification & Formulas

### a. Inputs
*   Planetary positions (geocentric, tropical).
*   Major aspects (Conjunction, Opposition, Square, Trine, Sextile).
*   Planet and aspect weights as defined in the `WovenMapBlueprint` schema.

### b. Core Calculations

**i. Magnitude (M)**
The Magnitude is the sum of the absolute strengths of all active aspects.

```
M = Σ | aspect_force |
```
where `aspect_force = orbStrength × planetWeight × sensitivity`

The final value is scaled to the **[0, 5]** range.

**ii. Directional Bias (DB)**
The Directional Bias is the sum of the signed, polarized strengths of all active aspects.

```
DB = Σ (aspect_force × aspect_polarity)
```
where `aspect_polarity` is:
*   **+1.0** for Trines, Sextiles (expansive)
*   **-1.0** for Squares, Oppositions (contractive)
*   **0.0** for Conjunctions (unpolarized by default)

The final value is scaled to the **[-5, +5]** range.

### c. Conjunction Policy
*   **Default:** Conjunctions are unpolarized (`polarity = 0`) in the core calculation. They contribute to Magnitude but not Directional Bias.
*   **Research Mode:** For diagnostic purposes, conjunctions may be "typed" (e.g., a Venus-Jupiter conjunction as expansive) but this **must not** alter the public-facing Directional Bias score.

### d. Field Signature

The `fieldSignature` is a normalized product of the two axes, representing the day's overall symbolic character.

```javascript
// v5.0 (Two-Factor Product)
fieldSignature = (directionalBias / 5) * (magnitude / 5);
```
This formula replaces the previous three-factor product that included `coherence`. The resulting `fieldSignature` remains in the **[-1, +1]** range.

## 4. Backstage Diagnostics (Non-Core)

Calculations for `volatility`, `aspect_count`, `median_orb`, and `top_driver` may be performed for internal analysis or to inform the narrative VOICE layer.

**Crucially, these diagnostics must never re-normalize or alter the public-facing Magnitude and Directional Bias scores.** They are maintained in a separate `_diagnostics` object.

### Uncanny Dependency Note
The "Uncanny" scoring system's coherence-penalty check is now keyed off the Directional Bias sign and strength, not a separate `coherence` value. This preserves research capabilities without reintroducing a non-geometric axis.

## 5. Output Schema

The official output for any Balance Meter v5.0 reading is a simple JSON object:

```json
{
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "magnitude": 4.5,
  "directional_bias": -2.3,
  "trace": [
    "Saturn square Sun (-1.8)",
    "Pluto opposition Mars (-1.5)",
    "Jupiter trine Venus (+0.9)"
  ],
  "_diagnostics": {
    "volatility": 0.02,
    "aspect_count": 12
  }
}
```

## 6. Versioning & Migration Guide (v4.0 → v5.0)

This v5.0 specification is a **breaking change**.

*   **Deprecation Notice:**
    *   `Coherence` is REMOVED as a core axis.
    *   `SFD` (Support-Friction Differential) is REMOVED.
    *   `Volatility` is demoted to an optional, non-core diagnostic.
    *   `Valence` is renamed to **Directional Bias**.

*   **Migration Steps:**
    1.  **Inputs:** No change. The system still consumes planetary positions and aspects.
    2.  **Processing:** Replace the multi-channel calculation logic with the simplified two-axis formulas defined in this document.
    3.  **Outputs:** Update the output schema to the v5.0 format. Remove all references to `coherence`, `volatility`, `sfd`, and `valence` from public-facing reports, displays, and APIs.
    4.  **Narrative Layer:** The VOICE layer should now describe concepts like "stability" or "fragmentation" as emergent narrative qualities, informed by diagnostic data (e.g., high aspect count, low median orb), rather than quoting a `Coherence` score.

## 7. Test Cases to Hold Ourselves To

The system's integrity will be validated against these benchmarks:

1.  **Golden Standard (2018-10-10):** Must produce Magnitude ≥ 4.5 and Directional Bias ≤ -4.0.
2.  **October 6, 2025:** Must render as Magnitude ≈ 3.9 and Directional Bias ≈ -2.3.
3.  **Saturation Test:** No week-long saturation at +5 or -5 under diverse aspect mixes.
4.  **Monotonicity:** Tighter orbs must never reduce Magnitude. Flipping a square to a trine must move Directional Bias toward positive.
5.  **Provenance Check:** The `trace` field must always explain the sign and magnitude of the day's scores.
