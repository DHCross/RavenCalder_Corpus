A Strange Cosmic Symbolism — Balance Meter v3

⸻

Core Principle — Map, Don’t Moralize

This is a symbolic weather map for inner and relational fields. It shows:
	•	How loud the day is (Magnitude).
	•	Which way it leans (Directional Bias).
	•	How stable the storyline is (Coherence).
	•	Whether forces work together or fragment (Integration Bias / SFD).

It never predicts behavior. It produces a climate readout that invites testable reflection.
	•	Sky geometry yields objective axes.
	•	Daily experience is logged alongside, never assumed identical.
	•	House placement grounds abstraction in lived domains: where the pressure lands.

⸻

The Four Axes (Neutral)

1) Magnitude (0–5) — How loud is the field?
	•	0–1 Background hum.
	•	2–3 Noticeable motifs.
	•	4 Strong clustering, palpable weight.
	•	5 Peak storm, chapter-defining.
Derived from raw aspect intensities; never suppressed into decimals.

⸻

2) Directional Bias (−5 → +5) — Which way is the flow leaning?
	•	−5 Maximum contraction / inward / enforced boundary.
	•	0 Neutral balance.
	•	+5 Maximum expansion / outward / boundary-dissolving.

Directional, not moral. Expansion can overwhelm; contraction can protect. Both must surface.

⸻

3) Narrative Coherence (0–5) — How stable is the story?
	•	0–1 Single-thread clarity.
	•	2 Mostly coherent; minor counter-pulls.
	•	3 Mixed storyline; ambiguous.
	•	4 Splintered; contradictory threads.
	•	5 Chaotic; no stable arc.

⸻

4) Integration Bias (SFD, −1 → +1) — Do forces cooperate or fragment?
	•	> 0 Net supportive — cooperation, stabilisation.
	•	0 Neutral — outcome depends on choice.
	•	< 0 Net friction — fragmentation, opposition.

SFD is the honesty check: prevents “red-wall bias” (crisis everywhere) or “greenwash bias” (false harmony).

⸻

Houses — Where Pressure Lands

Domains grounded by relocation:
	•	I. Self — body, resources, expression.
	•	II. Connection — communication, partnerships, networks.
	•	III. Growth — home, shared load, horizon.
	•	IV. Responsibility — work, career, dissolution.

Same sky, different rooms.

⸻

Sources of Force (Geometry → Scores)
	•	🎯 Orb: closeness = strength.
	•	∠ Aspect: majors roar, minors whisper.
	•	🪐 Potency: slower planets = tectonic, faster = sparks.
	•	📡 Resonance: amplifies at Sun, Moon, ASC, MC, Nodes.
	•	♾ Recursion: repeated themes echo louder.

Glyphs are clean: 🌀 = Coherence 5, 🌫 = Fog, ⚡ = Magnitude only.

⸻

Orbs — Gatekeepers

Tight orbs sharpen intensity, keep valence honest, and prevent soft trines from “padding” positivity.
Loose orbs capture climate background but blur the storyline.
	•	Tight (surgical): ≤3° majors, ≤1° minors.
	•	Loose (climate): ≤6° luminaries, ≤4° planets, ≤3° points, ≤1° minors.

Orbs remain quantitative filters only; they don’t moralize interpretation.
Always stamp orbs_profile for auditability.

⸻

Resilience & Depletion Layer

An add-on that combines symbolic scores with physiology (if logged).
	•	Stress Event: high magnitude + negative bias.
	•	Load: cumulative contraction pressure.
	•	Recovery: rebound within 1–2 days.
	•	Resilience: rolling index of recovery success.
	•	Depletion: quiet ≠ stable; flags collapse under low-magnitude, negative, fragmented days.

Keeps the model falsifiable against real resilience metrics (HRV, sleep, mood).

⸻

Narrative Layer (Optional)

Never moralize bias. Use motion words: extend, retract, concentrate, disperse.

Templates:
	•	Supportive, coherent expansion: Outward lean, steady storyline, aligned forces.
	•	Supportive, fragmented expansion: Outward lean, scattered openings.
	•	Restrictive, coherent: Inward lean, clean arc, distillation.
	•	Restrictive, fragmented: Inward lean, cross-pulls, rising pressure.

⸻

Reading a Day
	1.	Score all four axes.
	2.	Locate the houses.
	3.	Combine: Bias × Magnitude × Coherence × SFD.
	4.	Name one symbolic behavior consistent with the field.
	5.	Log lived outcome in neutral, testable terms.

⸻

Reconciliation Notes
	•	Restores signed Directional Bias (−5 ↔ +5).
	•	Keeps Magnitude real (0 ↔ 5 full scale).
	•	Clarifies Coherence as story stability.
	•	Centers SFD as differential honesty.
	•	Orbs kept as gatekeepers, not distorters.

⸻

Glossary
	•	Magnitude: loudness of archetypal charge.
	•	Directional Bias: contraction vs. expansion.
	•	Coherence: story stability.
	•	SFD: supportive vs. frictional net force.
	•	WB/ABE/OSR: shorthand for outcome fit.

Balance Meter v3 is the symbolic seismograph reborn.
It surfaces real storms (like Oct 10, 2018) instead of flattening them.
It maps the climate, never dictates the story.

Would you like me to also produce a short, one-page “field card” version of this spec — a quick reference for daily use, stripped of detail but impossible to misuse?
