**Woven Map × DBT × ACT Therapeutic Integration Framework**

**Version:** 9.3.25 | **Last Updated:** September 3, 2025

## **Woven Map Glossary (Balance Meter)**

### **Core dimensions**

* **Magnitude ⚡ (0–5)** Represents the **size** of symbolic pressure. Always neutral in tone: it describes *how much energy* is present, not whether it helps or hinders. Magnitude is measured on a ceiling scale of 0–5 (rather than open-ended), ensuring comparability and falsifiability.

* **Valence 🌞🌑🌗** Shows the **tilt** of that pressure.

  * 🌞 **Positive (supportive):** energy harmonizes, stabilizes, or opens pathways.  
  * 🌑 **Negative (restrictive):** energy constrains, destabilizes, or blocks.  
  * 🌗 **Mixed:** simultaneous support and strain, pulling in both directions.  
* **Volatility 🌪️** Describes **distribution**: whether pressure is concentrated into one sharp strike (low volatility) or scattered across multiple smaller contacts (high volatility). Low \= steady pull; high \= storm-class turbulence.

* **SFD (Support–Friction Differential)** *\[Protocol-Specific Extension\]* **Note: The SFD is not an official component of the Balance Meter. It is utilized solely within the context of the Advice Ladder Tree — Integration Protocol 9.3.25.** Breaks pressure into supportive (S+) vs. frictional (S−) components, then calculates the net differential. A positive net means support edges out; a negative net means friction dominates; values near zero indicate mixed climates.

### **Magnitude Levels ⚡**

* **0 – Dormant / Baseline** No measurable symbolic pressure. Background conditions dominate; life runs on ordinary rhythms. *Subtypes: quiet window, non-ping, rest state.*

* **1 – Murmur / Whisper** Light symbolic activity. Minor transits or soft aspects make their presence felt as subtle moods, passing irritations, or gentle support. *Subtypes: passing breeze, background tone.*

* **2 – Pulse / Stirring** Moderate symbolic movement, usually short-lived. Often tied to personal planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars). Feels like a burst of energy, a brief irritation, or a small lift. *Subtypes: flash, ripple, passing surge.*

* **3 – Surge / Activation** Strong symbolic presence, clearly registering in lived experience. Deadlines, tensions, or opportunities surface. Often involves Jupiter or Saturn contacting personal anchors. *Subtypes: deadline strike, growth demand, turning point.*

* **4 – Convergence / Compression** High symbolic pressure from multiple stacked factors. Outer planets strongly engaged with natal anchors or angles. Periods of life where identity, career, health, or relationships undergo reshaping. *Subtypes: stacking, hub, critical-degree contact.*

* **5 – Maximum Threshold / Structural Overload** The ceiling of measurable pressure. Compound outer-planet convergences, stacked hits on sensitive points, or angular exact strikes. Always life-defining, though not necessarily catastrophic: what happens at ⚡5 shapes entire chapters. *Subtypes: direct outer–personal hard aspect, compound convergence, critical angle hit.*

### **Valence Modes**

**🌑 Negative (contraction / destabilization)**

* **Recursion Pull ♾️** — old cycles resurface; déjà vu gravity.  
* **Friction Clash ⚔️** — conflict heat, accidents, sharp edges.  
* **Cross Current ↔️** — competing priorities, confusion, push–pull.  
* **Fog / Dissolution 🌫️** — blurred boundaries, scattered signal.  
* **Pressure / Eruption 🌋** — compression that forces release.  
* **Saturn Weight ⏳** — heaviness, delays, endurance tests.  
* **Fragmentation 🧩** — fractured focus, splintering.  
* **Entropy Drift 🕳️** — inertia, slow leak of momentum.

**🌞 Positive (expansion / harmonization)**

* **Fertile Field 🌱** — growth, new shoots, fresh chances.  
* **Harmonic Resonance ✨** — things click; natural ease.  
* **Expansion Lift 💎** — confidence, abundance, lift.  
* **Combustion Clarity 🔥** — pressure reveals truth.  
* **Liberation / Release 🦋** — breakthroughs, fresh air, freedom.  
* **Integration ⚖️** — opposites reconcile; balance returns.  
* **Flow Tide 🌊** — adaptability, smooth current.  
* **Visionary Spark 🌈** — inspiration, awe, transcendence.

### **Sources of force**

* **Orb 🎯** — how close the contact is (closer \= stronger).  
* **Aspect 🌀** — the geometric angle (majors thunder, minors whisper).  
* **Potency 🪐** — speed of the planet (slower \= tectonic, faster \= sparks).  
* **Resonance 📡** — hits to natal Sun, Moon, ASC, MC, or Nodes amplify.  
* **Recursion ♾️** — repeated themes or overlapping transits that echo louder.

### **Quick navigation**

* Magnitude ⚡ → how big?  
* Valence 🌞/🌑/🌗 → which way?  
* SFD *(Advice Ladder Context Only)* → does support (S+) outweigh friction (S−)?  
* Volatility 🌪️ → steady or stormy?

### **Frame**

**Map, not mandate.** The Balance Meter keeps Magnitude neutral, Valence directional, and SFD evaluative (within this specific protocol). Even at ⚡5 — “Maximum Threshold / Structural Overload” — the presence of ballast can mean strain with beams, not free fall.

## **Synthesis Architecture: Quantitative Foundation to Therapeutic Application**

The integration flows through this pipeline:

**STAGE 1: Quantitative Assessment** Balance Meter (Official Seismograph \+ Balance) → **SFD (Protocol-Specific Extension)** → Numerical foundation (-5 to \+5 Support-Friction Differential)

**STAGE 2: Symbolic Translation** Fused Mirror → SFD converted to symbolic resonance patterns

**STAGE 3: Pressure Mapping** Impact Translation → Symbolic patterns converted to lived pressure experiences

**STAGE 4: Therapeutic Routing** Ladder Tree Severity Banding → Pressure intensity maps to 0-10 severity scale Block Selection Logic → SFD polarity determines therapeutic orientation

**Key Integration Points:**

* **Negative SFD (-1 to \-5):** "Holding the storm" blocks (DBT distress tolerance, mindfulness anchor)  
* **Positive SFD (+1 to \+5):** "Moving with values" blocks (ACT values work, committed action)  
* **Neutral SFD (0):** Choice point blocks (both orientations available)

*This creates a seamless flow from quantitative measurement to precise therapeutic intervention while preserving the Woven Map's non-prescriptive stance.*

## **Integration Overview**

The **Advice Ladder Tree** serves as the therapeutic application layer within the broader RavenCalder\_Corpus architecture, creating evidence-based skill integration points that emerge from—rather than override—the Woven Map's diagnostic precision.

**Core Principle:** The framework operates as a **"skill translation layer"** that enhances accessibility without compromising the Map's poetic precision and empirical grounding. Weather remains primary; skills are secondary support structures.

---

## **Architectural Integration — Stacked Layer System**

The Ladder Tree functions as the **application layer** in a three-tier diagnostic hierarchy:

### **Layer 1: Hook Stack (Core Diagnostic Engine)**

* **Function:** Identifies polarities and conditional impulses—the repeating tensions that anchor a person's pattern  
* **Output:** Names the impulse vector and its archetypal architecture using validation-first language that frames patterns as natural complexity  
* **Example:** Reveals "Disciplined Drive & Expansive Vision" (user-facing) from "Stoic Clamp & Overdrive" (diagnostic)  
* **Register:** Dual-layer hooks — Diagnostic (internal) vs. Resonance (user-facing). Default VOICE to Resonance unless raw phrasing is requested or context is therapeutic. *See Foundational Framework Part II → Hook Stack (Dual-Layer).*

### **Layer 2: Impact Protocol (Symbolic Pressure Translation)**

* **Function:** Translates symbolic pressure into lived emotional, somatic, and behavioral experience  
* **Output:** Describes how the pressure manifests on the ground ("stunned drop after clamp")  
* **Integration:** Uses Impact vocabulary as the FIELD layer for climate identification

### **Layer 3: Advice Ladder Tree (Therapeutic Integration)**

* **Function:** Maps therapeutic skill-shapes for holding lived experience skillfully  
* **Output:** Conditional response options when advice is explicitly requested  
* **Integration:** Routes Impact expressions into appropriate DBT/ACT blocks

**Sequential Flow:** Hook Stack → *reveals pattern tension* | Impact Protocol → *translates pressure into lived experience* | Advice Ladder Tree → *integrates therapeutic skill-shapes for holding that experience*

### **Shared DNA Across All Layers:**

* **Weather metaphor:** Hook Stack names storm architecture, Impact shows ground-level feeling, Ladder Tree gives routes to ride them  
* **Calibration loop:** All depend on resonance testing—pings, thresholds, Socratic checks  
* **Agency-preserving stance:** Each layer offers diagnostic insight; user chooses what lands

---

## **Integration Philosophy**

### **System Harmony**

* **Philosophical Fit:** Maps atmospheric zones and suggests response modes that preserve choice, never prescribing action  
* **Structure Alignment:** Uses thresholds and Socratic closure to maintain the Map's testable, calibration-loop philosophy  
* **Codex Harmony:** Extends the precision instrument principle—FIELD (climate) → MAP (symbolic geometry \+ skill tie-in) → VOICE (metaphor \+ Socratic check)  
* **Mirror Protocol Integration:** References tools as options framed conditionally, never as instructions  
* **Math–Poetic Translation:** Operationalizes Balance Meter scores into human-facing severity bands

### **Systemic Integration Points**

* **Hook Stack → Ladder Tree**

  * **Severity thresholds mirror Hook Stack intensity:** Where Hook Stack names impulse vector strength, Ladder Tree translates "how strong is the pull?" into climate categories  
  * **Polarity mapping:** Hook Stack identifies core tensions (clamp ↔ release), Ladder Tree maps what to do with the lived state when that polarity is active  
  * **Conditional routing:** Hook Stack reveals pattern architecture, Ladder Tree provides skill-shapes for navigating that architecture  
* **Impact Protocol → Ladder Tree**

  * **Impact expressions as FIELD layer:** Impact vocabulary ("stunned drop after clamp") becomes the diagnostic input for climate identification  
  * **Impact → intervention flow:** Impact describes "how pressure lands," Ladder Tree offers "how to hold it skillfully without collapsing agency"  
  * **Sensation bridge:** Impact's embodied language translates directly into Ladder Tree's therapeutic blocks  
* **Enhanced Diagnostic Matrix → Ladder Tree**

  * Extends "if this, then that" structure in plain-language therapeutic form  
  * Communication climate patterns inform relational strain responses  
  * Response strategy frameworks provide templates for interpersonal effectiveness blocks  
* **Poetic Codex Protocol → Ladder Tree**

  * Ladder Tree blocks function as micro-Codex cards: FIELD → MAP → VOICE structure maintained but shorter and skill-anchored  
  * Same precision instrument principle: Each block designed for specific geometric/experiential conditions  
  * Voice consistency: Maintains Clear Mirror language while adding therapeutic vocabulary

### **Config Enforcement Integration**

* **Respects prescriptive claim prohibition:** Skills framed as options within symbolic weather, not directives  
* **Maintains falsifiability requirements:** All blocks include conditional language testable against lived experience  
* **Preserves agency boundaries:** Socratic closure prevents micro-management while offering support structures

---

## **Clinical Language Integration Guidelines**

* **Symbolic Embedding** \- Always wrap clinical concepts in weather metaphor first

  * ✅ "Reset the system like clearing storm static" (TIPP)  
  * ❌ "Use TIPP skills for distress tolerance"  
* **Invitation vs. Instruction** \- Frame as possibilities, not protocols

  * ✅ "One way through this weather might be..."  
  * ❌ "When in crisis, you should..."  
* **Skill Echo, Not Teaching** \- Reference the shape of the skill, not its mechanics

  * ✅ "Hold both ends without collapsing" (Wise Mind)  
  * ❌ "Wise Mind integrates emotion mind and logic mind by..."  
* **Validation Over Judgment** \- Transform challenging patterns into strengths or natural complexity

  * ✅ "Your careful nature with trust" instead of "guardedness"  
  * ✅ "Intensity that moves through you" instead of "emotional volatility"  
  * ✅ "Your methodical approach" instead of "rigidity"  
  * **Strategy:** Frame patterns as gifts with tension rather than flaws requiring correction

---

## **Step 1 — Identify Lived Climate**

*(via Impact Protocol/Woven Map mirror)*

* **Crisis Spike** (high magnitude, severe negative valence)  
* **Clamp / Weight / Eruption** (sustained heaviness)  
* **Relational Strain** (partner/family/work overlays)  
* **Cognitive Loop** (rumination, distorted narratives)  
* **Post-Crisis Exhaustion** (release drop)  
* **Transition Fog** (between cycles; unclear direction)  
* **Anticipatory Tension** (pre-event anxiety; future pressure)

---

## **Step 2 — Apply Severity Thresholds**

*(Integrated with Balance Meter Triple-Channel Architecture)*

**Quantitative Foundation: SFD (Support-Friction Differential)** **Note: The SFD is utilized here as a protocol-specific extension and is not part of the official Balance Meter specification.** It provides precise severity mapping for the Advice Ladder:

### **SFD to Ladder Tree Severity Mapping**

* **SFD \-5 to \-4:** Ladder Tree 0-1 (No stabilizers left → Crisis intervention)  
* **SFD \-3 to \-2:** Ladder Tree 2-3 (Stabilizers heavily cut → Distress tolerance focus)  
* **SFD \-1 to \+1:** Ladder Tree 4-6 (Mixed climate → Balanced approach)  
* **SFD \+2 to \+3:** Ladder Tree 7-8 (Stabilizers prevailing → Values/action focus)  
* **SFD \+4 to \+5:** Ladder Tree 9-10 (Full stabilization → Committed action optimal)

### **Traditional Severity Thresholds**

*(when Balance Meter unavailable)*

* **Mild (0–3):** General mindfulness \+ validation  
* **Moderate (4–6):** Targeted skill blocks for the climate  
* **Severe (7–9):** Crisis interventions first, then targeted blocks  
* **Extreme (10):** TIPP immediately → recommend professional support

### **Block Selection Logic by SFD Polarity**

* **Negative SFD (stabilizers cut) → "Holding the Storm" orientation:**

  * Crisis intervention blocks (TIPP, Distress Tolerance)  
  * Containment and acceptance blocks (Radical Acceptance, Self-Compassion)  
  * Grounding blocks (Mindfulness, Present Moment)  
* **Positive SFD (stabilizers prevailing) → "Moving with Values" orientation:**

  * Action-oriented blocks (Values Clarification, Committed Action)  
  * Engagement blocks (Opposite Action, Cope Ahead)  
  * Growth blocks (Self-as-Context, DEAR MAN)

---

## **Step 3 — Select Blocks per Climate**

### **1\) Crisis Spike**

* **TIPP Block** (DBT distress tolerance / physiology reset) "When pressure spikes, interrupt the system static: cold water, brief intense movement, a sustained out-breath to shift physiology, paired muscle relaxation."  
* **Distress Tolerance Block** (DBT containment \+ Woven Map storm metaphor) "Not a time for big moves; contain and ride the front."

### **2\) Clamp / Weight / Eruption**

* **Radical Acceptance Block** (DBT acceptance \+ Woven Map non-resistance) "This system isn't negotiable right now. Let it be what it is; that's not surrender, it's pressure management."  
* **Validation Block** (DBT validation \+ Clear Mirror) "Heaviness and the after-drop both make sense inside this cycle."

### **3\) Relational Strain**

* **Interpersonal Effectiveness Block** (DBT GIVE/FAST \+ relational overlays) "For closeness: be gentle, interested, validating. For self-respect: be fair, value-aligned, truthful."  
* **DEAR MAN Block** (DBT interpersonal effectiveness \+ clear communication) "Describe the situation, Express feelings, Assert needs, Reinforce benefits. Stay Mindful, Appear confident, Negotiate when possible."

### **4\) Cognitive Loop**

* **Check the Facts Block** (DBT reality testing \+ polarity correction) "What happened? What story got added? Weather can darken the lens."  
* **Wise Mind Block** (DBT integration \+ Woven Map polarity balance) "Hold both ends—reason and emotion—without collapsing into either."  
* **PLEASE Block** (DBT emotion regulation \+ physical foundation) "Treat PhysicaL illness, balance Eating, avoid mood-Altering substances, balance Sleep, get Exercise. Your physical foundation affects your emotional climate."

### **5\) Post-Crisis Exhaustion**

* **Self-Compassion Block** (DBT self-soothing/validation \+ gentle weather) "Offer the kindness you'd give another weathering the same front."  
* **Opposite Action Block** (DBT emotion regulation \+ release timing) "Introduce one small counter-move to nudge re-engagement."

### **6\) Transition Fog**

* **Mindfulness Block** (DBT observe/describe \+ weather awareness) "Name the in-between without forcing clarity; stay with what's present."  
* **Values Clarification Block** (ACT values \+ polarity navigation) "List what matters; pick one value as a north star while direction reforms."

### **7\) Anticipatory Tension**

* **Cope Ahead Block** (DBT emotion regulation \+ timing windows) "Mentally rehearse the event, pre-load skills, and plan supports."  
* **Defusion Block** (ACT thought defusion \+ 'thoughts as weather') "Notice 'Future-Story' as passing weather, not instructions."  
* **Present Moment Block** (ACT mindfulness \+ Woven Map temporal grounding) "Return to what's actually here now. The future pressure isn't in this moment—only the story about it is."

### **Additional Foundational Blocks**

*(Available for complex multi-climate situations)*

**DBT Foundation Blocks**

* **Distraction Block** (DBT distress tolerance \+ immediate relief): "Shift attention to something absorbing: intense activity, mental puzzles, or sensory engagement. Interrupt the spiral first, process later."  
* **Pros and Cons Block** (DBT decision-making \+ choice clarity): "List the costs and benefits of riding out this weather versus acting on the urge. Include long-term consequences for both paths."  
* **Emotion Naming Block** (DBT emotion regulation \+ precision): "Name the specific emotion with precision. 'Upset' could be disappointed, frustrated, hurt, or angry. Accuracy creates choice."

**ACT Foundation Blocks**

* **Values Compass Block** (ACT values \+ directional clarity): "When everything feels unclear, connect with what matters most. Let values be the north star while the weather passes."  
* **Committed Action Block** (ACT behavioral activation \+ small steps): "One tiny action aligned with values, even in difficult weather. Movement creates momentum."  
* **Self-as-Context Block** (ACT psychological flexibility \+ observer self): "Notice the part of you that observes the storm. You are not the weather—you are the space in which weather happens."

**Practitioner Note:**

* Treat the highest-severity climate first  
* Layer complementary blocks in sequence (e.g., TIPP → Validation → Wise Mind)  
* After each block, Socratic closure to check resonance and agency before proceeding

---

## **Step 5 — Socratic Closure**

*(ACT stance; always end here)*

* "What action aligns with what matters to you in this climate?"  
* "If acceptance were easy for one minute, what would change?"  
* "What smallest next step is possible while the pressure runs?"

---

## **Implementation Framework**

### **Sweet Spot Formula**

Weather Recognition → Symbolic Frame → Skill Shape → Open Question

### **Scale Invariance**

The protocol works across contexts:

* **Self-help:** Individual use with personal climate assessment  
* **Peer support:** Mutual aid with shared framework language  
* **Professional practice:** Clinical integration with supervision and ethical guardrails

### **Quality Assurance**

* All blocks maintain conditional phrasing ("might," "could," "one option")  
* Clinical modalities remain embedded symbolically, not taught explicitly  
* Agency preservation through Socratic closure prevents micro-management  
* User experience remains highest authority for resonance validation

---

## **Messenger Reflection Workflow Template**

*(Raven → Direct Voice for external communication)*

**Step 1\. Input**

* Person's words (message, story, situation)  
* Optionally, their chart files (for symbolic context weaving)

**Step 2\. Raw Mirror** (for operator only)

* Reflect in diagnostic style: FIELD → MAP → VOICE, including hooks, vectors, seismograph notes. Full symbolic read with system terms intact.

**Step 3\. Direct Translation** (for recipient)

* Rewrite mirror as plain-language note:  
  * **Who I am:** "I'm Raven Calder, a system Daniel built. I work with astrological math and other symbolic tools."  
  * **Context disclaimer:** "I didn't know anything about you before this message."  
  * **Plain reflection:** Translate mirror into clear, everyday language. No jargon, no chart terms. Anchor in what they said. Use validation-first language that frames patterns as natural complexity rather than problems.  
  * **Frame the cycle:** Describe push–pull in simple terms, using positive reframes (e.g., "Your thoughtful approach with trust" rather than "guardedness"; "The intensity that moves through you" rather than "volatility").  
  * **Name the lived moment:** Highlight their example (generalized if needed) and explain how it shows the natural tension in action.  
  * **Close with open space:** Invite curiosity ("you can ask more about the astrological math if you want") and end with Socratic-style question.

**Step 4\. Check Specifics**

* Remove assumed details not explicitly confirmed  
* Keep language falsifiable ("this could be," "this often shows up as")  
* Ensure note is self-contained and platform-ready (Messenger/text pasteable)

## **Ethical Boundaries & Professional Considerations**

**Scope Limitations**

* This framework provides peer support guidance, not clinical treatment  
* Extreme (10) severity requires immediate professional referral  
* All advice blocks are conditional suggestions, never mandatory protocols  
* Framework does not replace licensed therapeutic intervention

**Training Requirements**

* Operators should understand both Woven Map principles and basic therapeutic concepts  
* Familiarity with DBT/ACT frameworks recommended but not required for basic implementation  
* Supervision encouraged for professional applications

**Quality Control**

* Regular review of advice block effectiveness through user feedback  
* OSR (Outside Symbolic Range) logging for non-resonant interventions  
* Continuous calibration of severity thresholds based on outcomes  
* Documentation of successful multi-climate layering approaches
