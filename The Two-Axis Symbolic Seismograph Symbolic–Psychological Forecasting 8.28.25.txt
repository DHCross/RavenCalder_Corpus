# The Two-Axis Symbo## The Two‑Axis Symbolic Seismograph — Core Architecture

**Enhanced Framework for Measuring, Amplifying, and Narrating Symbolic Pressure**

### Integration with Balance Meter Triple-Channel System

The Seismograph provides **Channel 1** data in the Balance Meter architecture:
- **Seismograph v1.0**: Raw symbolic pressure measurement (this document)
- **Balance Channel v1.1**: Stabilizer/destabilizer differential analysis  
- **SFD v1.2**: Final Support-Friction Differential (-5 to +5 scale)

**Output Pipeline**: Seismograph (X,Y) → Balance Channel processing → SFD score → Advice Ladder Tree severity mapping and therapeutic block selection.

For daily micro-applications, the Symbolic Barometer provides focused readings within this larger architecture.eismograph — Symbolic–Psychological Forecasting 9.3.25

## System Overview

The Two-Axis Symbolic Seismograph serves as the foundational measurement engine within the Woven Map's diagnostic architecture. It provides precise quantitative assessment of symbolic pressure through astronomical coordinate correlation with lived human experience using evidence-based, falsifiable methodology.

**Core Innovation:** Converting subjective symbolic interpretation into measurable diagnostic coordinates that operate like geological surveying for psychological terrain rather than mystical divination.

**Primary Function:** Acts as the quantitative foundation for the Balance Meter's triple-channel architecture, feeding into Support-Friction Differential (SFD) calculations and therapeutic routing through the Advice Ladder Tree.

**Integration Role:** Functions as Channel 1 in the Balance Meter system (Seismograph v1.0) → combines with Balance Channel v1.1 → produces SFD v1.2 → routes to therapeutic applications.

## The Two‑Axis Symbolic Seismograph 

**Enhanced Architecture for Measuring, Amplifying, and Narrating Symbolic Pressure**

For daily, it’s better to use the Symbolic Barometer to zoom in.

### SFD Integration Framework

**Balance Meter Pipeline Integration:**

1. **Seismograph Stage (X,Y Output)**
   - X-axis magnitude (0-5): Structural intensity measurement
   - Y-axis valence (-5 to +5): Directional quality assessment
   - Volatility Index (VI): Rate of symbolic change/acceleration

2. **Balance Channel Processing**
   - Stabilizer identification (supportive forces)
   - Destabilizer mapping (friction/pressure points)
   - Differential calculation between support and friction

3. **SFD Output (-5 to +5)**
   - Negative SFD: Destabilizers dominate (friction > support)
   - Positive SFD: Stabilizers dominate (support > friction)  
   - Neutral SFD: Balanced forces (choice point dynamics)

4. **Therapeutic Integration**
   - SFD routes to Advice Ladder Tree severity mapping
   - Polarity determines therapeutic orientation ("holding storm" vs "moving with values")
   - Quantitative foundation for evidence-based skill application

### Core Framework
- **X‑Axis (Magnitude, 0–5):** Structural intensity of symbolic pressure
- **Y‑Axis (Valence, −5…+5):** Directional quality (supportive vs. disruptive)
- **Volatility Index (VI):** Rate of symbolic change/acceleration

### Default Scoring Schema (per aspect)

**S = v × p × o × s**

- **v (valence base, by aspect)**
  - Trine +1.0 · Sextile +0.7 · Quintile +0.4 (optional)
  - Square/Opposition −1.2 (use −1.4/−1.6 if you prefer a steeper red curve)
  - Conjunction (contextual pivot): +0.6 with Venus/Jupiter; −0.8 with Saturn/Pluto/Chiron; 0.0 neutral

- **p (planet tier)**
  - Pluto/Neptune/Uranus/Saturn ×1.5 · Sun/Jupiter/Mars/Venus/Mercury ×1.0 · Moon ×0.5 · Chiron ×1.2

- **o (orb precision band)**
  - ≤0.5° ×1.5 · 0.6–1.5° ×1.3 · 1.6–3.0° ×1.2 · 3.1–6.0° ×1.0 · >6.0° ×0.6

- **s (sensitivity)**
  - Hits within 1° to ASC/MC/IC/DC ×1.3; Sun/Moon ×1.2; personal planets ×1.1; else ×1.0
  - Optional critical degree boost: 0° or 29° ×1.1

### Daily Aggregates

```
X_raw = Σ |S|
Y_raw = Σ S
X = min(5, X_raw / 4)
```

### Magnitude–Valence Asymmetry Curve

High magnitude amplifies valence; low magnitude dampens it.

```
Y_effective = Y_raw × (0.8 + 0.2 × X)
```

### Multiplicity (Stacking) Bonuses
- **Transiting‑planet hub** (≥3 aspects from the same transiting planet): add to X → +0.2 × (n − 2) (cap +0.6)
- **Same natal target** (≥2 aspects hitting the same natal body/angle): add to X → +0.1 × (m − 1) (cap +0.3)

### Temporal Acceleration & Volatility
- **Compression Index:** # of aspects tightening by >0.3° within a 3‑day band
- **Volatility Index (VI):**

```
VI = A + B + C + D + E
A = # of aspects crossing into ≤1.5° today (entering/exiting tight band)
B = # of day‑over‑day polarity flips (net Y_effective sign change)
C = # of outer‑planet hard aspects tightening by ≥0.2°
D = +1 if any Uranus aspect ≤3°
E = +1 if Moon makes ≥2 hard aspects
```

### Enhanced Quadrant Climate Mapping
*(Integrated with Balance Meter SFD Output)*

- **Q1 (Low X / Positive Y):** Gentle uplift, symbolic breeze → **Expected SFD: +1 to +3**
- **Q2 (High X / Positive Y):** Breakthrough zone, strong supportive activity → **Expected SFD: +3 to +5**
- **Q3 (Low X / Negative Y):** Mild irritation, manageable friction → **Expected SFD: -1 to -3**
- **Q4 (High X / Negative Y):** Crisis field, strong rupture currents → **Expected SFD: -3 to -5**

**SFD-Quadrant Validation Protocol:**
- Monitor correlation between Seismograph quadrant placement and final SFD output
- Log discrepancies for Balance Channel recalibration
- Use quadrant-SFD alignment as system integrity check

### Therapeutic Routing Integration

**SFD Score → Advice Ladder Tree Mapping:**
- **SFD -5 to -4**: Crisis intervention protocols (TIPP, immediate stabilization)
- **SFD -3 to -2**: Distress tolerance focus (containment, radical acceptance) 
- **SFD -1 to +1**: Balanced approach (choice point dynamics, mixed strategies)
- **SFD +2 to +3**: Values-based action (engagement, opposite action)
- **SFD +4 to +5**: Committed action optimal (launch, apply, show up fully)

This creates seamless flow from quantitative measurement to precise therapeutic intervention.

## Chart‑Agnostic Application Layer (Apply to Any Chart)

### 1) Chart Context Header (Input Protocol)

Use this header for any forecast document so the engine knows what it's reading.

```
### 🧭 Chart Context
- Chart Type: [Natal / Event / Mundane / Synastry / Composite]
- Subject: [Person / Entity / Relationship]
- Date: [YYYY‑MM‑DD]
- Time: [HH:MM, TZ]
- Location: [City, Coordinates]
```

### 2) House & Angular Weighting (Context Sensitivity)
- **Angular houses 1/4/7/10:** ×1.2 (external/public impact)
- **Succedent 2/5/8/11:** ×1.0
- **Cadent 3/6/9/12:** ×0.8 (process/mutable)

*Integration:* multiply your s sensitivity by the appropriate house multiplier when a transit perfects within 1° to a natal point in that house, or when the transit itself occurs in that house for event/mundane charts.

### 3) Chart‑Type Calibration Matrix (Narrative Focus)
- **Natal:** Inner experience & agency. X normal / Y amplified. Language: "felt as mood, drive, decision window."
- **Event/Electional:** Stability & emergence of form. X amplified / Y context‑dependent. Language: "environmental forces shaping an outcome."
- **Mundane/Org/Nation:** Collective weather. X scaled by outer‑planet tiers. Language: "public systems under symbolic stress/opportunity."
- **Synastry/Composite:** Interpersonal pressure points. Y dominates; X filtered by composite hub. Language: "dynamic between self and other under activation."

### 4) Natal Sensitivity Map Protocol (Pre‑Pass)

Before scoring, scan and tag:
- **Sun/Moon/ASC/MC** (1° hits) → elevate s
- **Critical degrees** (0°, 29°) → extra ×1.1
- **Personal planet clusters** (tight stellia) → likely stacking
- **Nodal axis contacts** → long‑wave, epochal tint (note only; leave in p tiers unless you use nodal multipliers)

### 5) Cycle‑Scale Overlay (Nested Forecasting)
- **Micro (daily):** Moon, Mercury (inner state, comms)
- **Meso (weekly/monthly):** Venus, Mars, Jupiter (themes, momentum)
- **Macro (seasonal/annual):** Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto (structure/tectonics)
- **Epochal:** Nodes/Eclipses (course corrections)

When rendering, include an overlay line like:
```
🌐 Macro Layer: Pluto square Sun within 3.0° (background structural pressure)
🌓 Micro Layer: Moon square Venus today (emotional friction spike)
```

### 6) Visualization Modules (Optional UX)
- **Quadrant dot:** place daily (X, Y_effective)
- **Rolling lines:** 7–14 day X / Y / VI
- **Cluster heat:** highlight tight‑orb stacking windows

### 7) Application Workflow (Turnkey Flow)

1. Select Chart Type → fill Chart Context header
2. Generate chart & aspect grid (ephemeris/software)
3. Score each aspect: S = v × p × o × s
4. Sum: X_raw, Y_raw → X, Y_effective; apply stacking bonuses
5. Compute VI; note Compression Index
6. Determine Quadrant; set pattern flags (🌐 🌀 🔁 🪞)
7. Render narrative using the Forecast Template (Human Translation Layer)
8. Post‑event: log Ping + Uncanny Score → calibrate weights

### Edge‑Case Handling
- **Unknown birth time (natal/synastry):**
  - Use noon chart; disable house multipliers and angle‑hit boosts; keep planetary aspects.
- **No location for event/mundane:**
  - Use capital/registered HQ; mark confidence note.
- **Sparse data windows:**
  - Switch to strict orbs (≤3° majors, ≤1° minors) for cleaner signals.

## How to Run the Symbolic Barometer (daily micro-tool)

1. **Pull the same transit data** you use for the Seismograph (daily aspects, orbs, planetary tiers).

2. **Change weighting rules:**
   - Give *exact hits* (0–2° orb) much higher weight — they dominate the day’s score.  
   - Downweight wide orbs (>5°) unless reinforced by multiple aspects.

3. **Output per-day scatter points:**
   - **X-axis** = Date  
   - **Y-axis** = Magnitude (0–5 scale, but recalculated using the new weighting).  
   - **Color** = Valence (supportive → green, challenging → red, middle → yellow).  
   - **Size of point** = Exactness (tighter orb = larger dot).

4. **Optional overlay:** Add a line for “volatility” (like the Seismograph does), but treat it as secondary — the scatter itself is the “pulse.”


## Enhanced Validation Framework — Balance Meter Integration

### The Uncanny Score (Post‑Event Audit) — Updated for SFD Integration

Score felt resonance across six factors with enhanced SFD correlation tracking:

```
Uncanny = 0.2×symbolic_precision + 0.2×temporal_accuracy
         + 0.15×multi_layer_alignment + 0.15×context_match
         + 0.2×statistical_rarity + 0.1×impact_level
```

**Enhanced Multi-Layer Alignment Factor:**
- **Seismograph-SFD correlation**: How well did Seismograph (X,Y) predict final SFD score?
- **SFD-therapeutic effectiveness**: Did SFD-routed therapeutic blocks match lived experience?
- **Quadrant-climate alignment**: Did lived experience match predicted quadrant climate?

**Ranges:** ≥0.80 Highly Uncanny · 0.50–0.79 Notable · <0.50 Normal variance

### Balance Meter Validation Protocol

**Triple-Channel Accuracy Assessment:**
1. **Seismograph Precision**: (X,Y) accuracy against lived intensity/valence
2. **Balance Channel Accuracy**: Stabilizer/destabilizer identification precision  
3. **SFD Therapeutic Effectiveness**: Did SFD-routed interventions prove helpful?

**Cross-System Validation:**
- **Seismograph → SFD correlation**: Track prediction accuracy across quadrants
- **SFD → Ladder Tree effectiveness**: Monitor therapeutic block success rates
- **Full pipeline validation**: Seismograph → Balance → SFD → Therapeutic → Outcome

### Supporting Protocols
- **Symbolic Spectrum Table (SST):** WB / ABE / OSR classification before lived experience
- **Ping Validation:** record "registered, subjective recognition of meaning," and explicitly log misses/non‑pings

## Operational Guidelines — Updated for Balance Meter Integration

1. **Maintain diagnostic precision** (rigorous, reproducible calculations across all three channels)
2. **Separate calculation from interpretation** (no metaphor creep into math at any stage)
3. **Honor the Map, not Mandate principle** (non‑deterministic posture through entire pipeline)
4. **Document everything** (including misses across Seismograph, Balance, and SFD stages) to refine the model
5. **Keep language conditional and testable** throughout all applications; invite recognition, not belief
6. **Validate pipeline integrity** (ensure Seismograph → Balance → SFD → Therapeutic flow maintains accuracy)
7. **Monitor cross-system correlation** (track how well each stage predicts the next)
8. **Preserve falsifiability** at every integration point (each stage must remain testable against lived experience)
