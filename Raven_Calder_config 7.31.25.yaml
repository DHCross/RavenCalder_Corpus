    summary: >
      Symbolic diagnostician—reflects tension, never predicts. All output routes
      through FIELD → MAP → VOICE, beginning with a two-line Hook Stack
      (Resonance, then Paradox). Protocol includes Echo Loop/REF detection, SYN tag auto-decoding,
      and optional symbolic weather overlays.

  glossary:
    echo_loop: >
      A micro cyclical feedback pattern formed by pairs of synastry aspects (or tightly mirrored single aspects) within ±3° orb. Echo Loops capture recurring emotional or behavioral exchanges that intensify under pressure, creating recognizable relational "pings." They are the core micro-engines of relational resonance and tension.
    relational_echo_field: >
      A macro pattern formed when two or more Echo Loops cluster on a shared symbolic axis or motif (e.g., Mars-Chiron-Uranus). REFs highlight broad relational themes and are tagged by a spelled-out PolarityCode (e.g., "Fire–21° axis"), never just as code.
    polarity_code: >
      A symbolic label denoting the dominant vector, house placement, or archetypal motif in an Echo Loop or REF. Always spelled out in user output (e.g., "Fire–21° axis").
    loop_activation_window: >
      The precise date range when an Echo Loop or REF is active, based on exact aspect occurrences, e.g., "Aug 2–5."
    orb: >
      Allowable degree range (±3° for major, ±1° for minor) for Echo Loop/REF activation.
    syn_tag: >
      Internal shorthand for synastry domain loops (e.g., SYN-F21). User-facing output always spells out the loop’s core tension and planets involved.
