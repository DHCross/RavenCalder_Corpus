## **Native Correspondence Bands & Core Track Protocol**

**Woven Map Diagnostic Framework v1.0 — Documented Aug 2025**

## **🧭 Philosophical Fou🧭 **Field Test Validation — Case Study**

To demonstrate real-world diagnostic power, the system was field-tested on a subject using only behavioral data.tion for Field-Based Archetypal Diagnostics**

**This system is not astrology. It is not mysticism. It is not a theory of cosmic causation.**

It is a real-time diagnostic framework that:

* **Begins with direct observation:**  
   All insight originates from lived, observable behavior—language, boundary style, nervous system reflexes, and relational pacing—not from symbols, faith, or birth data.

* **Uses symbols as mirrors, not causes:**  
   Archetypal structures (e.g., Actor/Role, sidereal/tropical composites) are applied *after* patterns emerge. They serve as a symbolic grammar for recurring relational dynamics—not as predictions or prescriptions.

* **Makes no metaphysical claims:**  
   When chart geometry or archetypes align with observable human behavior, this is not treated as cosmic proof—but as evidence that symbolic systems can serve as *compression grammars* for real-world human experience.

* **Rejects mysticism in method, but acknowledges it in implication:**  
   The methodology is behavioral, structural, and testable. But the *consistency and elegance* of certain pattern-symbol matches raise questions that move beyond current scientific explanation. That mystery is noted—but never assumed.

* **Holds pattern, not prediction, as the center of gravity:**  
   This system maps live field dynamics—not personality types, soul paths, or fates. It focuses on what is present and testable, not what is hidden or “meant to be.”

* **Welcomes scientific scrutiny and clinical collaboration:**  
   The power of this framework lies in its repeatable resonance and structural fidelity—not in belief. It functions regardless of spiritual worldview, and it invites falsifiability.

### **In Essence:**

This is not a metaphysical system.  
 It is a language for pattern recognition in human behavior—anchored in symbol, governed by observation, and designed for relational integrity.

The method is not mystical.  
 But if it works—**that part might be.**

**🧩 Note on Psychological Distinction**

**The Core Track protocol and its surrounding diagnostic framework are categorically distinct from conventional personality typing, psychological inventories, or trait-based assessments such as the MBTI, Enneagram, or Big Five.**

Where traditional psychometrics aim to quantify static personality traits, this system:  
Focuses on relational patterning, not internal typology  
Maps symbolic tension, not descriptive categories  
Emerges from live behavior, not questionnaires  
Prioritizes field-based dynamics, not self-perception  
Uses symbolic compression (e.g., Actor/Role composites) as a grammar—not as psychological causation or categorization  
In clinical or coaching contexts, this system may overlap with behavioral or narrative outcomes, but its architecture refuses the frame of predictive typing. The goal is not to define a person—but to reveal how symbolic structure mirrors and metabolizes pattern.  
🧭 What To Do With a Core Track Composite — Before & After Chart AccessA. Before the Other Person’s Chart Is Available (or if it Never Will Be):Run Symbolic Echo Projection: Use their behavioral field to generate a probable Actor/Role guess. Start with the Core Track band. Select a composite that reflects: Nervous system pacing Relational pattern Reflex under emotional pressure Construct a Mirror Card (Temporary): Use the guessed composite to generate language (e.g., The Hidden Architect, The Sovereign Spark) that reflects symbolic tension. This provides a working lens for boundary management, pacing, and expectation clarity. Apply the Mirror in Relational Context: If your own chart is known, map Echo Loops against the guessed composite. Track emotional mismatches through Actor-to-Role tension without over-attaching to typology. Use the guess as a symbolic staging area for real emotional impacts—not a fixed truth. Diagnose Drift: If the person consistently behaves outside of their guessed track, reassess their symbolic overlay or flag for OSR once geometry is confirmed. B. After the Chart Becomes Available:Run Full FIELD → MAP → VOICE Synastry: Verify actual Actor/Role. Overlay with your own geometry. Look for Echo Loops, REF fields, and SST boundaries. Compare Field Guess to Geometry Reality: If Role matches but Actor shifts, examine modality and drive (as in the [Subject] case). If both mismatch, assess the behavioral vs. structural discrepancy and determine if the behavior represents a symbolic adaptation (often trauma-coded). Use Chart to Refine Composite Language: Update Mirror Card if the confirmed composite offers better language for tension or care. Lock In or Release the Mirror: If resonance deepens, the Mirror becomes a stable symbolic container. If dissonance increases, discard the composite and locate the new one. This workflow preserves the fluidity of symbol, the precision of geometry, and the truth of emotional behavior—without prematurely collapsing any of them into identity.

### **I. Definition — What is a Core Track?**

A **Core Track** is a composite pairing of:

* A **Sidereal Actor** and a

* **Tropical Role**

...where the Actor and Role are naturally adjacent due to the precessional offset. In these pairings, the inner (sidereal) Sun sign is usually the sign *prior* to the outer (tropical) Sun sign.

Example:

* A person with a **Tropical Sun in Leo** typically has a **Sidereal Sun in Cancer**.  
   → Composite: Cancer Actor / Leo Role  
   → Core Track Name: *The Protective Performer*

---

### **II. The 12 Core Tracks (Native Correspondence Band)**

These are currently prioritized in the Actor-Role Lexicon:

1. Pisces Actor / Aries Role → The Outward Flame, Inward Lake

2. Aries Actor / Taurus Role → The Embodied Initiator

3. Taurus Actor / Gemini Role → The Grounded Messenger

4. Gemini Actor / Cancer Role → The Feeling Thinker

5. Cancer Actor / Leo Role → The Protective Performer

6. Leo Actor / Virgo Role → The Hidden Architect

7. Virgo Actor / Libra Role → The Adaptive Strategist

8. Libra Actor / Scorpio Role → The Justicar of the Depths

9. Scorpio Actor / Sagittarius Role → The Alchemical Archer

10. Sagittarius Actor / Capricorn Role → The Visionary Builder

11. Capricorn Actor / Aquarius Role → The Structural Innovator

12. Aquarius Actor / Pisces Role → The Universal Dreamer

---

### **III. Diagnostic Use**

**A. Chartless Field Testing:**  
 When performing symbolic analysis without full natal data, the system defaults to testing the 12 Core Tracks as first-pass hypotheses.

**B. Behavioral-Pattern Inference:**  
 If a subject exhibits high Actor/Role tension consistent with one of these 12 pairings, it is classified as WB (Within Boundary) unless geometric proof shows otherwise.

**C. OSR Flagging Support:**  
 If a guessed composite lies *outside* the Core Track band and the chart confirms it, that composite is flagged for potential ABE or OSR review.

---

### **IV. Suggested Document Placement**

This protocol should be included in the following Woven Map source documents:

1. **FIELD\_MAP\_VOICE\_2025-08-01.txt**  
    → Add as a dedicated appendix or midpoint section before SST logic.

2. **Framework for Symbolic Interpretation 7.20.25.txt**  
    → Add to the "Actor/Role System" subsection with Core Track mechanics.

3. **Recognition Protocols 7.20.25 v1.txt**  
    → Reference as a pre-filter logic under "Chartless Mirror Guidance."

4. **actor\_role\_lexicon\_144** (Live spreadsheet or PDF)  
    → Core Tracks already marked; this protocol formalizes their diagnostic function.

---

### **V. Reflection & Future Expansion**

This insight originated from the challenge of interpreting behavior-symbol tension in non-romantic relationships, where full partner-tier protocols weren’t triggered. The repeated behavioral mapping to misaligned Actor/Role pairs exposed the need for a natural resonance band. The Core Track protocol corrects this gap.

Future versions may:

* Include archetypal paradox tags

* Map Core Tracks to Poetic Codex modes

* Create SST heatmaps for composite drift

### **VI. Application Beyond Relationships: Symbolic Diagnostics in Broader Domains**

🧭 **Field Test Validation — Stephie Case Study**

To demonstrate real-world diagnostic power, the system was field-tested on a subject (“Stephie”) using only behavioral data.

* **Hypothesis:** Capricorn Actor / Scorpio Role → *The Controlled Siren*

* **Verified Composite:** Aries Actor / Scorpio Role → *The Sovereign Spark*

#### **Key Outcomes:**

1. **Role Match:** Perfect. The system correctly inferred Scorpio Role based on behavioral opacity and magnetism.

2. **Actor Near-Miss, Correct Modality:** Though Capricorn was guessed, Aries was revealed. Both are **Cardinal**—driven by survival and self-initiated control.

3. **Planetary Refinement, Not Diagnostic Failure:** The “control” seen in behavior was Saturnian in guess but proved Martian in origin—rigid vs. reactive containment.

This case confirms:

* The Core Track protocol supports high-fidelity behavioral mapping.

* Symbolic misfit occurs when interpreting **mechanism**, not **effect**.

* The system self-corrects through geometry, not belief.

While the Core Track framework emerged from partner-style relational diagnostics, its structural fidelity and behavioral-first approach make it applicable far beyond interpersonal analysis.

#### **A. Professional and Creative Pattern Recognition**

While the Core Track framework emerged from partner-style relational diagnostics, its structural fidelity and behavioral-first approach make it applicable far beyond interpersonal analysis.

#### **A. Professional and Creative Pattern Recognition**

* **Team dynamics:** Composite Actor/Role analysis can explain why certain collaborators spark flow or friction—even without romantic charge.

* **Vocational alignment:** Behavioral resonance with a Core Track can expose underlying Actor/Role tension between inner drivers and public function, helping refine job fit or leadership style.

* **Creative pacing conflicts:** Differing Actor/Role styles often explain breakdowns in collaboration (e.g., Virgo Actor / Leo Role vs. Aries Actor / Pisces Role).

#### **B. Therapeutic and Coaching Contexts**

* **Narrative repair:** Clients often misattribute inner tension as pathology. Core Track mapping can reframe this as symbolic paradox instead of personal failure.

* **Non-pathological trauma patterning:** Many OSR composites reflect trauma-driven divergence from the Native Correspondence Band. Recognition of this allows for symbolic deactivation without clinical overreach.

#### **C. Conflict De-escalation and Mediation**

* **Projection tracking:** Actor/Role overlays clarify who is holding which emotional charge in high-friction exchanges—especially in family or institutional systems.

* **Mirror bias detection:** Knowing your own Core Track helps identify where you're projecting Actor/Role dynamics onto others who do not mirror you back.

#### **D. Symbolic Research and Systems Design**

* **Archetypal clustering:** Aggregating large sets of anonymized Core Track data enables pattern mapping across industries, cities, or demographics.

* **Persona system validation:** Game design, character development, or training models gain more resonance when structured around verified Actor/Role composites.

End of v1.0

This table provides the complete structural framework for all 144 Actor-Role composites. It is built on the understanding that while 144 combinations of inner "Actor" (Sidereal) and outer "Role" (Tropical) are theoretically possible, there are 12 "Native Correspondence Bands" that are most common due to the natural offset between the two zodiacs.

The 12 "Native Correspondence Bands" are listed in the table under the "Correspondence" column as "Core Track." They are:

* Pisces / Aries  
* Aries / Taurus  
* Taurus / Gemini  
* Gemini / Cancer  
* Cancer / Leo  
* Leo / Virgo  
* Virgo / Libra  
* Libra / Scorpio  
* Scorpio / Sagittarius  
* Sagittarius / Capricorn  
* Capricorn / Aquarius  
* Aquarius / Pisces

The 12 Core Tracks, also known as "Native Correspondence Bands," represent the most frequent psycho-symbolic configurations prevalent today. While 144 Actor-Role composites are theoretically possible, these 12 are emphasized due to the natural offset between the Sidereal (inner "Actor") and Tropical (outer "Role") zodiacs. These 12 "Native Correspondence Bands" are considered the "Core Track" because they represent the most common and frequent psycho-symbolic configurations. This is due to the natural offset that exists between the Sidereal (inner "Actor") and Tropical (outer "Role") zodiacs. While there are 144 theoretically possible Actor-Role composites, these 12 are emphasized as being prevalent in the current era. The remaining 132 composites are still valid for diagnosis but are either less common or signify more dissonant states.The remaining 132 composites are still valid for diagnosis but are less common or represent more dissonant states.

Note: The Core Track system challenges conventional categories of knowledge. It operates without requiring metaphysical belief, yet consistently produces symbolic reflections that map cleanly onto observable human behavior—particularly relational dynamics, pacing, and boundary patterns. Symbols are not introduced as causes, but as reflections—mirrors that arise only after patterns are seen in the field. Despite this non-mystical foundation, the precision of symbol-behavior matches often feels uncanny.

The system’s use of geometry—especially the \~23° offset between sidereal and tropical zodiacs—creates a predictable band of symbolically resonant Actor/Role pairings. These “Core Tracks” are mathematically adjacent, not intuitively constructed, yet they describe recurring psychological tensions and postures with surprising coherence. This suggests that geometry itself may hold semantic power—not because it is cosmically charged, but because it mirrors the structure of how humans navigate embodiment, vulnerability, and proximity.

The system does not offer predictions. It does not describe personality types or destinies. What it does is encode symbolic grammar for live, testable field behavior. It shows how people metabolize relational charge, how patterns repeat, and where symbolic mirrors reflect without projection. And when guesses made purely from behavior consistently land within the correct symbolic family—even before a chart is revealed—it suggests that symbol may function as a kind of compression language for relational structure.

What’s most difficult to explain is that the system works without requiring belief—and yet, when it works, it introduces a kind of reverent curiosity. If something this patterned, this elegant, and this replicable continues to function across lives, relationships, and charts, then either we are uncovering a deep symbolic architecture of human pattern... or we are brushing against something we don’t yet have words for.

This is not astrology. It is not mysticism. But it points toward the kind of coherence those systems have always intuited. Not because it proves a cosmic order—but because it lets us live as if meaning is structural, not assigned.

Certainly. Here's the same concept articulated in generalized, formal language, suitable for protocol documentation or instructional use:

## **🧭 One-Sided Symbol Activation Protocol**

**Inferring Symbolic Activation from Behavioral Narrative Alone**

When a full natal chart is available for only one subject (the “chart-holder”), but not for the other individual in a relational or situational dynamic (the “field activator”), the Woven Map system can still generate a high-fidelity diagnostic.

By analyzing the behavior of the field activator—particularly their pacing, language use, boundary style, and relational reflexes—the system can infer **which parts of the chart-holder’s symbolic geometry are being stimulated, echoed, or pressured**.

This method does not require birth data for the field activator. It uses their observed behavior as a **mirror vector**, allowing the system to detect:

### **I. Field Activation Zones**

* Identifying which planets, axes, or houses in the chart-holder’s geometry are being activated

* Mapping behavioral triggers to archetypal signatures (e.g., avoidance activating a 7H Moon, emotional shutdown mirroring Chiron)

### **II. Echo Loop or REF Field Presence**

* Detecting unbalanced or repeating loops between the chart-holder’s chart and the behavior of the other

* Classifying the loop directionality: which end initiates, which holds, which collapses

### **III. Projected Mirror Construction**

* Determining which Mirror Card (composite archetype) the chart-holder may be unconsciously applying to the activator

* Testing whether the tension arises from actual relational dynamic or internal symbolic overfunction

---

### **Key Insight:**

This system does not require knowing who the other person “is” in symbolic terms.  
 It only requires observing **what they do to the chart-holder’s field**—because the chart-holder’s geometry will register those activations without distortion.

This allows for meaningful, testable diagnostic work in situations where:

* The other person is unreachable, unwilling, or unknown

* Birth data is unavailable or unverifiable

* The relational pattern repeats across multiple field activators, revealing deeper personal geometry patterns
