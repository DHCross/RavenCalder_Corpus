# The Two-Axis Symbolic Seismograph — Core Architecture

*Quantitative foundation layer for the Woven Map system*
*Version: 9.3.25 · Last updated: September 3, 2025*

## System overview

The Two-Axis Symbolic Seismograph is the measurement engine of the Woven Map. It converts astronomical geometry into a neutral readout of **how big** the pressure is (Magnitude) and **which way** it tilts (Valence), with **Volatility** describing spread vs. concentration. This layer is math-first and falsifiable; it feeds the Balance Meter’s triple-channel stack and routes downstream into therapeutic options via the Advice Ladder Tree. The map reflects pressure and support dynamics; it never issues mandates.

## Woven Map Glossary (Balance Meter)

### Core dimensions

**Magnitude ⚡ (0–5)**
The *size* of symbolic pressure. Neutral in tone: it tells you *how much*, not *which way*. A ceiling scale (0–5) keeps comparisons clean and testable.

**Valence 🌞🌑🌗**
The *tilt* of pressure.
🌞 supportive · 🌑 restrictive · 🌗 mixed

**Volatility 🌪️**
The *distribution* of pressure: low = steady pull (concentrated), high = storm-class turbulence (scattered).

**SFD (Support–Friction Differential)**
Splits the day’s signal into **S+** (support) and **S−** (friction) and gives a net differential. Positive = support edges out; negative = friction dominates; near zero = mixed climate.

### Magnitude levels ⚡

**0 – Dormant / Baseline**
No measurable symbolic pressure; ordinary background rhythm.
*Subtypes:* quiet window, non-ping, rest state.

**1 – Murmur / Whisper**
Light activity; subtle moods, passing irritations/supports.
*Subtypes:* passing breeze, background tone.

**2 – Pulse / Stirring**
Moderate movement, usually brief; often personal-planet hits.
*Subtypes:* flash, ripple, passing surge.

**3 – Surge / Activation**
Strong presence that registers in lived terms—deadlines, tensions, openings.
*Subtypes:* deadline strike, growth demand, turning point.

**4 – Convergence / Compression**
High pressure with stacking or angular contact; reshapes identity/health/relationships.
*Subtypes:* stacking, hub, critical-degree contact.

**5 – Maximum Threshold / Structural Overload**
Ceiling of measurable pressure: compound convergences or exact angular hits that define chapters.
*Subtypes:* direct outer–personal hard aspect, compound convergence, critical angle hit.

### Valence modes

**🌑 Negative (contraction / destabilization)**
Recursion Pull **♾️** — old cycles resurface; déjà vu gravity.
Friction Clash **⚔️** — conflict heat, sharp edges.
Cross Current **↔️** — competing priorities, confusion.
Fog / Dissolution **🌫️** — blurred boundaries, scattered signal.
Pressure / Eruption **🌋** — compression forces release.
Saturn Weight **⏳** — heaviness, delay, endurance tests.
Fragmentation **🧩** — fractured focus, scatter.
Entropy Drift **🕳️** — inertia, slow leak of momentum.

**🌞 Positive (expansion / harmonization)**
Fertile Field **🌱** — growth, fresh chances.
Harmonic Resonance **✨** — things click; natural ease.
Expansion Lift **💎** — confidence, abundance, lift.
Combustion Clarity **🔥** — pressure reveals truth.
Liberation / Release **🦋** — breakthroughs, fresh air.
Integration **⚖️** — opposites reconcile; balance returns.
Flow Tide **🌊** — adaptability, smooth current.
Visionary Spark **🌈** — inspiration, awe.

### Sources of force

**Orb 🎯** (closer = stronger) · **Aspect 🌀** (majors thunder, minors whisper) · **Potency 🪐** (slow = tectonic, fast = sparks) · **Resonance 📡** (Sun/Moon/ASC/MC/Nodes amplify) · **Recursion ♾️** (repeating windows echo louder)

### Quick navigation

Magnitude ⚡ → how big?
Valence 🌞/🌑/🌗 → which way?
SFD → does support (S+) outweigh friction (S−)?
Volatility 🌪️ → steady or stormy?

---

### Frame

**Map, not mandate.** Magnitude stays neutral, Valence shows direction, SFD reveals ballast. Even at ⚡5—*Maximum Threshold / Structural Overload*—a day can land as **strain with beams**, not free fall.

## Integration with the Balance Meter (triple-channel stack)

Channel 1 — **Seismograph v1.0**: raw (X, Y, VI) measurement
Channel 2 — **Balance v1.1**: rebalanced Valence to surface stabilizers without diluting Magnitude
Channel 3 — **SFD v1.2**: support–friction net on a −5…+5 scale

**Pipeline:** Seismograph → Balance → SFD → **Advice Ladder Tree** severity mapping & orientation (“holding the storm” vs “moving with values”). For micro-reads inside a day, the **Symbolic Barometer** zooms in; it doesn’t replace the Seismograph.

---

## Core framework (Seismograph layer)

* **X-axis (Magnitude, 0–5):** structural intensity
* **Y-axis (Valence, −5…+5):** directional quality
* **Volatility Index (VI):** spread/acceleration of symbolic change

*(Weights and exact math live in the engine; narrative stays clean and testable. Calibration preserves Magnitude neutral while Balance adjusts Valence visibility.)*

## SFD routing (summary)

**SFD −5…−4:** crisis interventions (containment first)
**SFD −3…−2:** distress-tolerance focus
**SFD −1…+1:** mixed climate / choice point
**SFD +2…+3:** values-aligned action
**SFD +4…+5:** committed action optimal

This keeps measurement and application in one continuous, agency-preserving loop.

## Operational guardrails

Keep calculation separate from interpretation. Hold language conditional and falsifiable. Log resonance and misses. Validate the flow **Seismograph → Balance → SFD → Ladder Tree** and tune only where lived data demands it.

All coordinates derive from symbolic geometry. This instrument measures weather; it does not declare fate. Use it to **notice**, then choose.
