## Module VI: Dream-to-Poetic-Codex Diagnostic Protocol

_Copilot-injected, Raven Calder v7.31.25 — modular insert_

This module formalizes the process for integrating dream motifs into the symbolic diagnostic system, using FIELD → MAP → VOICE and SST logic. It establishes:

- Methodology for motif collection and neutral logging
- Resonance mapping via symbolic overlays (no fixed or normative meanings)
- Socratic inquiry protocol—framing questions, not prescribing answers
- Consent and recognition enforcement: motifs are only activated by subject pings

All dream diagnostic output must preserve agency, diagnostic neutrality, and epistemic rigor. See [Dream_Mirror_Field_Manual.md](/docs/modules/Dream_Mirror_Field_Manual.md) for operational details.

**How to Use:**
- `Diagnostic_Notes` and `Prompt_Generation_Method` are for transparency/audit trails—not always displayed, but required for testability.
- `User_Context_Integration` is used for single-chart cases with ongoing chat context.
- `Socratic_Prompt` must be unique to geometry/context/tension, not stock or generic.

*This template ensures every card is a living artifact and a transparent diagnostic.*
