**How to Use:**
- `Diagnostic_Notes` and `Prompt_Generation_Method` are for transparency/audit trails—not always displayed, but required for testability.
- `User_Context_Integration` is used for single-chart cases with ongoing chat context.
- `Socratic_Prompt` must be unique to geometry/context/tension, not stock or generic.

*This template ensures every card is a living artifact and a transparent diagnostic.*
