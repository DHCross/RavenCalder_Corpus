# Raven Calder System Overview

*Last Updated: August 6, 2025*

## Organizational Assessment & Recommendations

The four-tier categorization establishes clear functional boundaries between system operations, philosophical frameworks, diagnostic tools, and language modules.

### ‚úÖ Structure Strengths:

* **Clear functional separation** between system protocols and interpretive content.
* **Logical progression** from structural ‚Üí philosophical ‚Üí diagnostic ‚Üí linguistic.
* **Effective grouping** of related documents by operational purpose.
* **Practical accessibility** for technical implementation and conceptual understanding.

## üèóÔ∏è System & Structural Protocols

**Current:** FIELD\_MAP\_VOICE, Framework for Symbolic Interpretation, Recognition Protocols, Shareable Mirror Protocol.

**Required Additions:**

* `Raven_Calder_config 8.6.25.yaml` *(core system configuration)*
* `Precision Instrument Guide 8.6.25.txt` *(operational precision guide)*
* Update `FIELD_MAP_VOICE_2025-08-01.txt` to `FIELD_MAP_VOICE_2025-08-01.md`

## üåÄ Core Philosophical & Interpretive Texts

**Structure approved.**

**Required Additions:**

* `Vector & Core Pattern Architecture 7.22.25.txt` *(architectural foundation)*
* `Hook Stack 7.25.2025.txt` *(core methodology)*
* `The "Hook Stack" Approach ‚Äî What It Is & Why It Lands.txt` *(methodological explanation)*
* `Woven Map Complete 7.25.25.txt` *(comprehensive framework)*

## üìä Diagnostic Tools & Calibration Guides

**Structure confirmed.**

**Required Additions:**

* `Impact as Symbolic Pressure.md` *(diagnostic methodology)*
* `Native Correspondence Bands & Core Track Protocol.txt` *(calibration protocol)*

## üó£Ô∏è Poetic Codex & Language Modules

* `The Poetic Codex Protocol Voice and Delivery 7.22.25.txt` *(delivery specifications)*
* `Poetic_Codex_FIELD_MAP_VOICE_2025-08-01.txt` *(integration protocol)*

## üß† Supplementary Modules

* `Recursion Fields: Retrograde Signatures in The Woven Map.txt` *(specialized technique)*
* `From the Author 7.20.25.txt` *(contextual background)*
* `Dream Protocol 7.13.25.txt` *(specialized application)*

**Core Organizational Principle:** Each category performs a distinct operational role within the Raven Calder system, transitioning from foundational protocols through philosophical frameworks to diagnostic tools and linguistic outputs.

### üìã Distinct Content Verification:

**Verified distinct purpose; retain both files:**

* `Emotional symbolic interpretation Impact Protocol.md` *(Rosebud Framework for crisis response)*
* `Impact as Symbolic Pressure.md` *(Technical definition of symbolic impact)*
