# Raven Calder System Overview
*Last Updated: August 6, 2025*

## Organizational Assessment & Recommendations

**Your proposed structure is solid and logically organized.** The four-tier categorization creates clear functional boundaries between system operations, philosophical framework, diagnostic tools, and language modules. 

### ‚úÖ Strengths of Your Structure:
- **Clear functional separation** between system protocols and interpretive content
- **Logical progression** from structural ‚Üí philosophical ‚Üí diagnostic ‚Üí linguistic
- **Good grouping** of related documents by operational purpose
- **Practical accessibility** for both technical implementation and conceptual understanding

### üîß Suggested Refinements:

## üèóÔ∏è System & Structural Protocols
**Current:** FIELD_MAP_VOICE, Framework for Symbolic Interpretation, Recognition Protocols, Shareable Mirror Protocol

**Recommended Additions:**
- `Raven_Calder_config 8.6.25.yaml` *(core system configuration)*
- `Precision Instrument Guide 8.6.25.txt` *(operational precision guide)*
- `FIELD_MAP_VOICE_2025-08-01.txt` ‚Üí **Update to** `FIELD_MAP_VOICE_2025-08-01.md` *(newer version exists)*

## üåÄ Core Philosophical & Interpretive Texts  
**Current structure is excellent.** 

**Recommended Additions:**
- `Vector & Core Pattern Architecture 7.22.25.txt` *(architectural foundation)*
- `Hook Stack 7.25.2025.txt` *(core methodology)*
- `The "Hook Stack" Approach ‚Äî What It Is & Why It Lands.txt` *(methodological explanation)*
- `Woven Map Complete 7.25.25.txt` *(comprehensive framework)*

## üìä Diagnostic Tools & Calibration Guides
**Current structure works well.**

**Recommended Additions:**
- `Impact as Symbolic Pressure.md` *(diagnostic methodology)*
- `Native Correspondence Bands & Core Track Protocol.txt` *(calibration protocol)*

## üó£Ô∏è Poetic Codex & Language Modules
**Well-organized section.**

**Recommended Additions:**
- `The Poetic Codex Protocol Voice and Delivery 7.22.25.txt` *(delivery specifications)*
- `Poetic_Codex_FIELD_MAP_VOICE_2025-08-01.txt` *(integration protocol)*

## üß† Supplementary Modules
**Good catch on the accessibility note.**

**Recommended Additions:**
- `Recursion Fields: Retrograde Signatures in The Woven Map.txt` *(specialized technique)*
- `From the Author 7.20.25.txt` *(contextual background)*
- `Dream Protocol 7.13.25.txt` *(specialized application)*

## Final Assessment: **APPROVED WITH ENHANCEMENTS**

Your organizational schema provides excellent structural clarity and functional grouping. The suggested additions would create a more comprehensive system map while maintaining your logical categorization principles.

**Key Organizational Principle:** Each category serves a distinct operational function in the Raven Calder system, from foundational protocols through philosophical framework to diagnostic implementation and linguistic output.

## üóÇÔ∏è OLD VERSION IDENTIFICATION & CLEANUP RECOMMENDATIONS

### ‚ùå Files to DELETE (Older Versions):

**1. `FIELD_MAP_VOICE_2025-08-01.txt`**
- **Reason:** Superseded by `FIELD_MAP_VOICE_2025-08-01.md` (newer markdown format)
- **Action:** DELETE

**2. `Woven Map.txt`**
- **Reason:** Superseded by `Woven Map Complete 7.25.25.txt` (newer, complete version)
- **Action:** DELETE

**3. `The Woven Map Precision Instrument Guide 7.14.25.txt`**
- **Reason:** Superseded by `Precision Instrument Guide 8.6.25.txt` (newer version)
- **Action:** DELETE

### üîç Files Requiring Version Consistency Updates:

**Multiple files reference `Raven_Calder_config 7.31.25.yaml` but current config is `8.6.25.yaml`**

Files needing reference updates:
- `The Poetic Codex Protocol Voice and Delivery 7.22.25.txt` (2 references)
- `Framework for Symbolic Interpretation 7.20.25.txt` (1 reference)
- `README.md` (1 reference)

**Internal version inconsistency:**
- `Raven_Calder_config 8.6.25.yaml` still shows `version: "7.31.25"` internally - should be updated to `8.6.25`

### üìã Distinct Content Verification:

**These files appear similar but serve different purposes (KEEP BOTH):**
- `Emotional symbolic interpretation Impact Protocol.md` - Rosebud Framework for crisis response
- `Impact as Symbolic Pressure.md` - Technical definition of impact in symbolic interpretation

### üéØ Priority Cleanup Actions:

1. **‚úÖ COMPLETED** - Deleted the 3 superseded files
2. **‚úÖ COMPLETED** - Updated version references in 4 files to point to current config
3. **‚úÖ COMPLETED** - Updated internal version number in config file from 7.31.25 to 8.6.25

**Cleanup Results:** Successfully removed 3 redundant files, eliminated version confusion, and ensured all references point to current system configuration (8.6.25).
