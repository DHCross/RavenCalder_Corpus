Concept Guide: The "AstrologerAPI" (Legacy)Status: Archived (Historical Term)This document clarifies the historical term "AstrologerAPI" and maps its function to the current "Pure Next.js" architecture.This is not the app's main API. For the app's actual API specification, see the canonical API_REFERENCE.md.1. Historical DefinitionIn the legacy "hybrid beast" architecture, "AstrologerAPI" referred to a third-party, external API service.Function: Its only job was to provide raw astrological geometry (planet positions, house cusps) when given a date, time, and location.Role: It was a data dependency. The old app would call this external API to get the raw math data, which it would then process.Status: This concept of a separate, standalone API for geometry is obsolete.2. Consolidation in "Pure Next.js"In the "Pure Next.js" architecture, this functionality is no longer a separate, public-facing API. It has been consolidated and is now an internal module of the Astro Brain.New Location: src/math-brain/api-client.jsNew Name: This module is referred to as the "Transit Engine" in the ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md.This api-client.js module still calls an external service to get geometry, but it is a private implementation detail. It is no longer a core part of the app's public-facing architecture.3. The Actual App API (Canonical)When we discuss "the API" in the current project, we are referring to the app's own, single, authoritative endpoint.This is the API that the frontend (or any developer) uses to get a complete, processed report.Endpoint: POST /api/astrology-mathbrainSpecification: API_REFERENCE.md (ACC Spec v2)Function: This is the orchestrator that:Receives the user's subject and settings.Calls the Astro Brain (which uses the api-client.js internally).Receives the final JSON (the "ACC Spec v2").Calls the Poetic Brain via the VOICE layer (see NARRATIVE_LAYER_INTEGRATION.md).Returns the complete JSON + Markdown report.SummaryTermWhat It MeansStatus"AstrologerAPI" (Legacy)The old, third-party API that only provided raw geometry.Archived. This function is now a private module: src/math-brain/api-client.js.API_REFERENCE.md (Canonical)This app's main API. Defines the POST /api/astrology-mathbrain endpoint and the "ACC Spec v2" JSON it returns.Active & Authoritative. This is the only API spec that matters.
