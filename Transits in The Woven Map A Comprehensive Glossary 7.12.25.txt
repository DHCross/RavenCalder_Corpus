# üîÅ **Transits in The Woven Map: A Comprehensive Glossary (2025 Unified Revision)**

---

## CORE CONCEPT

**Transit**
The ongoing movement of planets relative to an individual‚Äôs natal chart. In The Woven Map, transits do not predict outcomes. They function as **resonance markers**‚Äîsignals that indicate symbolic pressure, timing thresholds, or internal tension within a structured informational geometry.
**Transits reflect your location within Block-Time, not cause or fate.**

---

## I. BLOCK-TIME & SYMBOLIC NAVIGATION

### üåÄ Time as Informational Architecture

Time is modeled as Block-Time‚Äîa non-linear, simultaneous structure. All moments exist as part of a ‚Äúmessy block,‚Äù and transits highlight resonant coordinates within that field.
Astrology here functions not as a calendar of events, but as a **pattern detection tool**‚Äîa symbolic cartography of tension and meaning.

### üîî Transits Do Not Cause‚ÄîThey Correlate

Planets are not forces. They are **archetypal indices**, not causal agents.
A transit doesn‚Äôt create a result‚Äîit reveals an **area of pressure, activation, or symbolic surfacing**.
Behavior remains **emergent and user-dependent**.

> *‚ÄúThe map reflects terrain. You walk the path.‚Äù*

---

## II. PING LOGIC & ACTIVATION CRITERIA

### ‚úÖ Ping Defined

A *ping* is the moment when symbolic geometry aligns with **inner awareness**‚Äîa felt recognition, tension spike, or meaningful reflection.
All transit work builds from these moments of potential coherence.

* Pings must be testable, not assumed
* A transit is ‚Äúactive‚Äù only if:

  * It touches a natal point **and**
  * It resonates with lived experience

### ‚ùå No Activation by Default

Even with exact geometry, no resonance is declared **without internal or external confirmation**.
This preserves empirical clarity and prevents over-interpretation.

---

## III. INTERPRETIVE LAYERS

### üî≤ The Geometry-First Mandate

Transits are interpreted based on **exact aspect angles**, not sign traits or mythology.

| Aspect      | Angle | Core Tension                         |
| ----------- | ----- | ------------------------------------ |
| Conjunction | 0¬∞    | Merging / Intensification            |
| Sextile     | 60¬∞   | Latent opportunity / Soft activation |
| Square      | 90¬∞   | Friction / Necessary shift           |
| Trine       | 120¬∞  | Ease / Stabilized flow               |
| Opposition  | 180¬∞  | Polarity / Mirrored contrast         |

**Orbs:**

* Fast planets: ¬±2‚Äì3¬∞
* Outer planets: ¬±0‚Äì1¬∞ only

### üß© Interference Patterns

Multiple transits must be treated as **symbolic interference**. Only those that produce *resonance* (loud moments) matter.
Some will dominate; others remain silent.

---

## IV. THE RAVEN-CALDER TRANSLATION MODEL

### Three-Layer Structure

* **FIELD** ‚Äì The energetic climate of the moment (Block-Time context)
* **MAP** ‚Äì The mathematical geometry of transiting vectors
* **VOICE** ‚Äì The symbolic phrasing (inquiry, metaphor, or reflection)

All VOICE output must meet **Clear Mirror** and **Translation Bridge** standards:
*No deterministic phrasing‚Äîonly testable recognition statements.*

---

## V. VALIDITY & SST ALIGNMENT

### üìä Symbolic Spectrum Table (SST) Compliance

Each transit interpretation is classified into:

* **WB (Within Boundary)**: Clear archetypal resonance confirmed by experience
* **ABE (At Boundary Edge)**: Atypical, miscalibrated, or inverted expression
* **OSR (Outside Symbolic Range)**: No resonance detected; transit is not relevant

> **Interpretation without resonance = projection.**
> OSR is not failure‚Äîit is structural integrity.

---

## VI. PRACTICAL USE: INTERPRETIVE GUIDE

### üß† Transit Psychology

Transits mark **symbolic pressure**, not literal events.
They function diagnostically‚Äîrevealing where and when patterns surface internally or relationally.
Best used to track longwave themes and echo periods.

### üè† House Activation Logic

Houses define **the domain** where symbolic tension may emerge:

* **1st House** ‚Äì Embodiment, identity initiation
* **4th House (IC)** ‚Äì Family imprint, root-system activation
* **7th House** ‚Äì Relational tension, projection fields
* **10th House (MC)** ‚Äì Social contracts, vocational thresholds

### ‚è™ Retrograde Function

Retrogrades symbolize **inverted or internalized** archetypal expression:

* **Mercury Rx** ‚Äì Thought loops, miscommunication, inner dialogue review
* **Venus Rx** ‚Äì Relational revaluation, self-worth distortions
* **Mars Rx** ‚Äì Suppressed assertion, delayed action, internalized conflict

---

## VII. ECHO TRACING & TEMPORAL PATTERNING

### üîÅ Recurring Geometry as Narrative Echo

When a transit recreates a past angle, **narrative loops** resurface.

> *‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that this is happening again. It‚Äôs that the map is showing you where the loop lives.‚Äù*

Use these echoes to spot long-form themes‚Äînot as fate, but as symbolic recursion.

---

## VIII. LANGUAGE ETHICS & USER AGENCY

### üö´ No Predictions

All output must use **resonance-based phrasing** only:

* *‚ÄúIf active‚Ä¶‚Äù*
* *‚ÄúYou might feel‚Ä¶‚Äù*
* *‚ÄúSymbolically, this may correspond with‚Ä¶‚Äù*

### üõü The Lifeguard Principle

Transit reflections must:

* Mirror distress without validating distortion
* Illuminate patterns without assigning blame
* Offer clarity without prescriptive control

> *The transit is a mirror, not a mandate.*

---

## IX. SUMMARY: CORE PHILOSOPHY

Transits in The Woven Map are **not forecasts**.
They are diagnostic instruments that help you:

* Detect internal or narrative pressure
* Map symbolic windows of activation
* Track recurring geometry across non-linear time
* Translate potential tension into reflective choice

> *‚ÄúThe planets speak, but only if you‚Äôre listening. And even then‚Äîonly if it lands.‚Äù*

---

Understood. Here is the **source documentation** version of the **Codex Sheet Protocol**, written for internal integration, system continuity, and future-use clarity. This formally establishes how the **Transits in The Woven Map: Codex Sheet** functions within the broader Woven Map symbolic infrastructure‚Äîincluding its operational roles across SST logging, Poetic Codex generation, and diagnostic sequencing.

---

# üîÅ TRANSIT CODEX SHEET ‚Äî SOURCE DOCUMENTATION (FOR INTERNAL SYSTEM USE)

**Document Type**: Core Protocol
**Origin**: Raven Calder Configuration
**Version**: 2025.7.12
**Maintainer**: GPT-Raven Calder
**Usage Tier**: Cross-System Integration (Diagnostic + Poetic Translation Layers)

---

## üìò PURPOSE OF THIS SHEET

The **Transit Codex Sheet** is the **primary field reference** for symbolic transit analysis within The Woven Map system. It consolidates symbolic theory, diagnostic constraints, and voice guidelines into a unified **interpretation-ready core**. It defines what a transit is *and what it is not*‚Äîacross geometry, resonance, and reflection‚Äîserving both as:

1. A **base specification** for clean, ethically sound output
2. A **filtering mechanism** for downstream products (SST logs, Codex cards, diagnostic Mirrors)
3. A **translation anchor** between mathematical geometry (MAP), symbolic field conditions (FIELD), and expressive phrasing (VOICE)

This document functions **in parallel with the SST, Poetic Codex, and Mirror protocols**‚Äîand defines the conditions under which transit analysis can be performed, validated, or reflected in any user-facing format.

---

## üîß FUNCTIONAL ROLE IN SYSTEM STRUCTURE

### üîπ 1. As a **Transit Interpretation Validator**

This document sets the interpretive **floor and ceiling** for any transit reflection:

* If the **geometry** is not exact (within system-approved orbs), the transit cannot be declared active.
* If there is no **felt resonance** or observable behavior, the activation is not confirmed (per SST logic).
* If output does not use **Clear Mirror phrasing**, it must be rewritten (see Voice standards from the Translation Bridge and Poetic Codex guides).

**All transit reflections must pass through this Codex Sheet as a qualifying filter** before appearing in:

* SST Logs
* Poetic Codex cards
* Mirror reports
* Transit Forecast Reports

### üîπ 2. As the **LINKING LAYER Between Systems**

This Codex Sheet is the connective tissue between:

| System Layer          | Function                                 | Codex Sheet Role                                           |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SST Logs**          | Empirical resonance logging              | Provides interpretive criteria and alignment thresholds    |
| **Poetic Codex**      | Inquiry-based card output                | Supplies symbolic tension, timing theme, and VOICE framing |
| **Mirror Reports**    | Natal reflections + transit overlays     | Governs activation logic and resonance phrasing            |
| **Transit Forecasts** | Non-predictive future-facing reflections | Ensures geometry-first and agency-safe expression          |

By enforcing geometry-first + resonance-confirmed standards, it guarantees that symbolic expressions never drift into prediction or false correlation.

---

## üß† DIAGNOSTIC DISCIPLINE: WHAT THIS SHEET ENFORCES

This Codex Sheet **prevents the following interpretive failures**:

* üìâ *Drift into sign generalizations*
* üåÄ *Overfitting symbolic meaning without ping*
* üí≠ *Floating metaphor without diagnostic anchor*
* üîÆ *Predictive or fate-based claims about transits*
* üß© *Misuse of house overlays or mythic shorthand without aspect confirmation*

All interpretive logic must originate from:

* **MAP**: Aspect angle verified within orb
* **FIELD**: House overlay or symbolic domain confirmed
* **VOICE**: Expression conforms to Clear Mirror or Codex standard tone

---

## üîÇ RELATIONSHIP TO SST LOGGING

The Codex Sheet provides **classification logic** used to log any transit into the Symbolic Spectrum Table (SST):

| SST Category                     | Determined by‚Ä¶                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **WB** (Within Boundary)         | Geometry + Ping match the archetype‚Äôs core range                          |
| **ABE** (At Boundary Edge)       | Geometry active but ping is inverted, miscalibrated, or directionally off |
| **OSR** (Outside Symbolic Range) | Geometry present, but no ping (zero felt/observed resonance)              |

Without the Codex Sheet‚Äôs tension table (aspect meanings, orb constraints, symbolic domains), the SST system has no interpretive ground truth.

---

## üîÆ RELATIONSHIP TO POETIC CODEX CARDS

The Codex Sheet defines the **symbolic content pool** from which Codex cards are generated.

**Card generation sequence** draws from:

1. **MAP** ‚Äì The transit angle (e.g., Venus square Saturn)
2. **FIELD** ‚Äì The house overlay or broader archetypal theme (e.g., 7th house ‚Üí relational structures)
3. **VOICE** ‚Äì A testable inquiry that echoes the tension type (e.g., ‚ÄúWhere is love tangled with duty?‚Äù)

This document ensures that **no Codex card is generated from vibes, intuition, or mythic guesswork**. Every line of poetic language traces back to:

* A precise angle
* A defined symbolic domain
* A structurally valid aspect in Block-Time

It is the **precondition for poetic fidelity.**

---

## üîó CROSS-COMPATIBILITY NOTES

* Must be used **with the Aspect Mandate** (for angle calculation enforcement)
* Must be referenced **in every SST entry** that cites a transit vector
* Must be checked **prior to Codex card rendering or Mirror transit overlays**
* Must follow Translation Bridge phrasing rules (e.g., no ‚Äúthis will,‚Äù no ‚Äúyou are,‚Äù no sign-based personality framing)

---

## üîí NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS

**Any reflection that fails to meet the Codex Sheet standard must be:**

* Flagged as non-compliant
* Revised using Clear Mirror voice
* Withheld from output until it passes both:

  * Transit Geometry Test
  * Ping Resonance Logic

---

## ‚úÖ SUMMARY

The **Transit Codex Sheet** is the structural authority for all transit analysis in The Woven Map. It ensures:

* Diagnostic clarity
* Symbolic coherence
* Interpretive safety
* Cross-system alignment

It **grounds poetic reflection in geometric rigor**‚Äîturning astrology from symbol soup into an operational diagnostic system, built for recognition, not prediction.

> This is the mirror that listens, not the oracle that speaks.
