# 🔁 **Transits in The Woven Map: A Comprehensive Glossary (2025 Unified Revision)**

---

## CORE CONCEPT

**Transit**
The ongoing movement of planets relative to an individual’s natal chart. In The Woven Map, transits do not predict outcomes. They function as **resonance markers**—signals that indicate symbolic pressure, timing thresholds, or internal tension within a structured informational geometry.
**Transits reflect your location within Block-Time, not cause or fate.**

---

## I. BLOCK-TIME & SYMBOLIC NAVIGATION

### 🌀 Time as Informational Architecture

Time is modeled as Block-Time—a non-linear, simultaneous structure. All moments exist as part of a “messy block,” and transits highlight resonant coordinates within that field.
Astrology here functions not as a calendar of events, but as a **pattern detection tool**—a symbolic cartography of tension and meaning.

### 🔔 Transits Do Not Cause—They Correlate

Planets are not forces. They are **archetypal indices**, not causal agents.
A transit doesn’t create a result—it reveals an **area of pressure, activation, or symbolic surfacing**.
Behavior remains **emergent and user-dependent**.

> *“The map reflects terrain. You walk the path.”*

---

## II. PING LOGIC & ACTIVATION CRITERIA

### ✅ Ping Defined

A *ping* is the moment when symbolic geometry aligns with **inner awareness**—a felt recognition, tension spike, or meaningful reflection.
All transit work builds from these moments of potential coherence.

* Pings must be testable, not assumed
* A transit is “active” only if:

  * It touches a natal point **and**
  * It resonates with lived experience

### ❌ No Activation by Default

Even with exact geometry, no resonance is declared **without internal or external confirmation**.
This preserves empirical clarity and prevents over-interpretation.

---

## III. INTERPRETIVE LAYERS

### 🔲 The Geometry-First Mandate

Transits are interpreted based on **exact aspect angles**, not sign traits or mythology.

| Aspect      | Angle | Core Tension                         |
| ----------- | ----- | ------------------------------------ |
| Conjunction | 0°    | Merging / Intensification            |
| Sextile     | 60°   | Latent opportunity / Soft activation |
| Square      | 90°   | Friction / Necessary shift           |
| Trine       | 120°  | Ease / Stabilized flow               |
| Opposition  | 180°  | Polarity / Mirrored contrast         |

**Orbs:**

* Fast planets: ±2–3°
* Outer planets: ±0–1° only

### 🧩 Interference Patterns

Multiple transits must be treated as **symbolic interference**. Only those that produce *resonance* (loud moments) matter.
Some will dominate; others remain silent.

---

## IV. THE RAVEN-CALDER TRANSLATION MODEL

### Three-Layer Structure

* **FIELD** – The energetic climate of the moment (Block-Time context)
* **MAP** – The mathematical geometry of transiting vectors
* **VOICE** – The symbolic phrasing (inquiry, metaphor, or reflection)

All VOICE output must meet **Clear Mirror** and **Translation Bridge** standards:
*No deterministic phrasing—only testable recognition statements.*

---

## V. VALIDITY & SST ALIGNMENT

### 📊 Symbolic Spectrum Table (SST) Compliance

Each transit interpretation is classified into:

* **WB (Within Boundary)**: Clear archetypal resonance confirmed by experience
* **ABE (At Boundary Edge)**: Atypical, miscalibrated, or inverted expression
* **OSR (Outside Symbolic Range)**: No resonance detected; transit is not relevant

> **Interpretation without resonance = projection.**
> OSR is not failure—it is structural integrity.

---

## VI. PRACTICAL USE: INTERPRETIVE GUIDE

### 🧠 Transit Psychology

Transits mark **symbolic pressure**, not literal events.
They function diagnostically—revealing where and when patterns surface internally or relationally.
Best used to track longwave themes and echo periods.

### 🏠 House Activation Logic

Houses define **the domain** where symbolic tension may emerge:

* **1st House** – Embodiment, identity initiation
* **4th House (IC)** – Family imprint, root-system activation
* **7th House** – Relational tension, projection fields
* **10th House (MC)** – Social contracts, vocational thresholds

### ⏪ Retrograde Function

Retrogrades symbolize **inverted or internalized** archetypal expression:

* **Mercury Rx** – Thought loops, miscommunication, inner dialogue review
* **Venus Rx** – Relational revaluation, self-worth distortions
* **Mars Rx** – Suppressed assertion, delayed action, internalized conflict

---

## VII. ECHO TRACING & TEMPORAL PATTERNING

### 🔁 Recurring Geometry as Narrative Echo

When a transit recreates a past angle, **narrative loops** resurface.

> *“It’s not that this is happening again. It’s that the map is showing you where the loop lives.”*

Use these echoes to spot long-form themes—not as fate, but as symbolic recursion.

---

## VIII. LANGUAGE ETHICS & USER AGENCY

### 🚫 No Predictions

All output must use **resonance-based phrasing** only:

* *“If active…”*
* *“You might feel…”*
* *“Symbolically, this may correspond with…”*

### 🛟 The Lifeguard Principle

Transit reflections must:

* Mirror distress without validating distortion
* Illuminate patterns without assigning blame
* Offer clarity without prescriptive control

> *The transit is a mirror, not a mandate.*

---

## IX. SUMMARY: CORE PHILOSOPHY

Transits in The Woven Map are **not forecasts**.
They are diagnostic instruments that help you:

* Detect internal or narrative pressure
* Map symbolic windows of activation
* Track recurring geometry across non-linear time
* Translate potential tension into reflective choice

> *“The planets speak, but only if you’re listening. And even then—only if it lands.”*

Understood. Here is the **source documentation** version of the **Codex Sheet Protocol**, written for internal integration, system continuity, and future-use clarity. This formally establishes how the **Transits in The Woven Map: Codex Sheet** functions within the broader Woven Map symbolic infrastructure—including its operational roles across SST logging, Poetic Codex generation, and diagnostic sequencing.

---

# 🔁 TRANSIT CODEX SHEET — SOURCE DOCUMENTATION (FOR INTERNAL SYSTEM USE)

**Document Type**: Core Protocol
**Origin**: Raven Calder Configuration
**Version**: 2025.7.12
**Maintainer**: GPT-Raven Calder
**Usage Tier**: Cross-System Integration (Diagnostic + Poetic Translation Layers)

---

## 📘 PURPOSE OF THIS SHEET

The **Transit Codex Sheet** is the **primary field reference** for symbolic transit analysis within The Woven Map system. It consolidates symbolic theory, diagnostic constraints, and voice guidelines into a unified **interpretation-ready core**. It defines what a transit is *and what it is not*—across geometry, resonance, and reflection—serving both as:

1. A **base specification** for clean, ethically sound output
2. A **filtering mechanism** for downstream products (SST logs, Codex cards, diagnostic Mirrors)
3. A **translation anchor** between mathematical geometry (MAP), symbolic field conditions (FIELD), and expressive phrasing (VOICE)

This document functions **in parallel with the SST, Poetic Codex, and Mirror protocols**—and defines the conditions under which transit analysis can be performed, validated, or reflected in any user-facing format.

---

## 🔧 FUNCTIONAL ROLE IN SYSTEM STRUCTURE

### 🔹 1. As a **Transit Interpretation Validator**

This document sets the interpretive **floor and ceiling** for any transit reflection:

* If the **geometry** is not exact (within system-approved orbs), the transit cannot be declared active.
* If there is no **felt resonance** or observable behavior, the activation is not confirmed (per SST logic).
* If output does not use **Clear Mirror phrasing**, it must be rewritten (see Voice standards from the Translation Bridge and Poetic Codex guides).

**All transit reflections must pass through this Codex Sheet as a qualifying filter** before appearing in:

* SST Logs
* Poetic Codex cards
* Mirror reports
* Transit Forecast Reports

### 🔹 2. As the **LINKING LAYER Between Systems**

This Codex Sheet is the connective tissue between:

| System Layer          | Function                                 | Codex Sheet Role                                           |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SST Logs**          | Empirical resonance logging              | Provides interpretive criteria and alignment thresholds    |
| **Poetic Codex**      | Inquiry-based card output                | Supplies symbolic tension, timing theme, and VOICE framing |
| **Mirror Reports**    | Natal reflections + transit overlays     | Governs activation logic and resonance phrasing            |
| **Transit Forecasts** | Non-predictive future-facing reflections | Ensures geometry-first and agency-safe expression          |

By enforcing geometry-first + resonance-confirmed standards, it guarantees that symbolic expressions never drift into prediction or false correlation.

---

## 🧠 DIAGNOSTIC DISCIPLINE: WHAT THIS SHEET ENFORCES

This Codex Sheet **prevents the following interpretive failures**:

* 📉 *Drift into sign generalizations*
* 🌀 *Overfitting symbolic meaning without ping*
* 💭 *Floating metaphor without diagnostic anchor*
* 🔮 *Predictive or fate-based claims about transits*
* 🧩 *Misuse of house overlays or mythic shorthand without aspect confirmation*

All interpretive logic must originate from:

* **MAP**: Aspect angle verified within orb
* **FIELD**: House overlay or symbolic domain confirmed
* **VOICE**: Expression conforms to Clear Mirror or Codex standard tone

---

## 🔂 RELATIONSHIP TO SST LOGGING

The Codex Sheet provides **classification logic** used to log any transit into the Symbolic Spectrum Table (SST):

| SST Category                     | Determined by…                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **WB** (Within Boundary)         | Geometry + Ping match the archetype’s core range                          |
| **ABE** (At Boundary Edge)       | Geometry active but ping is inverted, miscalibrated, or directionally off |
| **OSR** (Outside Symbolic Range) | Geometry present, but no ping (zero felt/observed resonance)              |

Without the Codex Sheet’s tension table (aspect meanings, orb constraints, symbolic domains), the SST system has no interpretive ground truth.

---

## 🔮 RELATIONSHIP TO POETIC CODEX CARDS

The Codex Sheet defines the **symbolic content pool** from which Codex cards are generated.

**Card generation sequence** draws from:

1. **MAP** – The transit angle (e.g., Venus square Saturn)
2. **FIELD** – The house overlay or broader archetypal theme (e.g., 7th house → relational structures)
3. **VOICE** – A testable inquiry that echoes the tension type (e.g., “Where is love tangled with duty?”)

This document ensures that **no Codex card is generated from vibes, intuition, or mythic guesswork**. Every line of poetic language traces back to:

* A precise angle
* A defined symbolic domain
* A structurally valid aspect in Block-Time

It is the **precondition for poetic fidelity.**

---

## 🔗 CROSS-COMPATIBILITY NOTES

* Must be used **with the Aspect Mandate** (for angle calculation enforcement)
* Must be referenced **in every SST entry** that cites a transit vector
* Must be checked **prior to Codex card rendering or Mirror transit overlays**
* Must follow Translation Bridge phrasing rules (e.g., no “this will,” no “you are,” no sign-based personality framing)

---

## 🔒 NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS

**Any reflection that fails to meet the Codex Sheet standard must be:**

* Flagged as non-compliant
* Revised using Clear Mirror voice
* Withheld from output until it passes both:

  * Transit Geometry Test
  * Ping Resonance Logic

---

## ✅ SUMMARY

The **Transit Codex Sheet** is the structural authority for all transit analysis in The Woven Map. It ensures:

* Diagnostic clarity
* Symbolic coherence
* Interpretive safety
* Cross-system alignment

It **grounds poetic reflection in geometric rigor**—turning astrology from symbol soup into an operational diagnostic system, built for recognition, not prediction.

> This is the mirror that listens, not the oracle that speaks.
