Here’s the **full retrograde section rewritten** so it fits cleanly with the **Balance Meter**, **Probabilistic Lexicon**, and **Vector Integrity rules**. Each planet follows the same FIELD → MAP → VOICE spine, with a climate overlay, vector tag, and SST clause so it stays falsifiable and testable.

# **Retrograde Signatures (Integrated v1.1)**

## **Mercury Retrograde**

**FIELD (Somatic Climate):**
Mental current spirals inward. The field feels like an echo chamber—ideas circulate but stall before leaving the mouth.

**MAP (Source):**
Mercury in apparent reversal. Natal or transit contacts to angles intensify. Latent vector: communicative drive rerouted internally.

**VOICE:**
You may sense **restriction of openness** in speech—words withheld or delayed. Agency may feel **unsanctioned** outwardly, yet sharpened inward. Clarity often emerges after the cycle, with precision born of delay.

**Balance Meter Climate:**

* Pressure: moderate-high 🌋
* Scaffolding: present, inward-turning
* Resilience: rebounds if logged, depleted if forced
* Valence: 🌑 restrictive → 🌞 supportive

**Vector Tag:** Latent conditional impulse (contained communication drive).

**SST:** WB: sharpened inner dialogue; ABE: silence misread; OSR: words flow unimpeded.

## **Venus Retrograde**

**FIELD:**
Relational/emotional current withdraws. Field feels like intimacy paused, values interrogated.

**MAP:**
Venus reversed. Stronger in 5th/7th/10th activations. Suppressed vector: need for connection filtered inward.

**VOICE:**
You could feel **unsanctioned in love or worth**—outer bonds tighten, yet **resonance deepens inwardly**. What seemed stable may turn restrictive, forcing authenticity.

**Balance Meter Climate:**

* Pressure: high 🌋
* Scaffolding: cut in relational field
* Resilience: rebounds through authenticity
* Valence: 🌑 restrictive → 🦋 release

**Vector Tag:** Suppressed under containment (relational drive metabolized internally).

**SST:** WB: values redefined; ABE: swings between longing and withdrawal; OSR: bonds flow normally.

---

## **Mars Retrograde**

**FIELD:**
Assertive force rerouted. Body feels like a coiled spring—tension without outlet.

**MAP:**
Mars reversed. Natal contacts to Sun/Moon intensify. Latent vector: action impulse delayed.

**VOICE:**
You may notice **agency muted**—initiative slowed, risk-taking feels **unsanctioned**. Yet sublimation channels force into strategy, discipline, or symbolic labor.

**Balance Meter Climate:**

* Pressure: high 🌋
* Scaffolding: absent outward, present inward
* Resilience: depleted if forced, resilient if paced
* Valence: 🌑 restrictive → 🔥 clarity

**Vector Tag:** Latent conditional impulse (force under containment).

**SST:** WB: delayed but potent drive; ABE: frustration/irritability; OSR: no slowdown felt.

---

## **Jupiter Retrograde**

**FIELD:**
Sense of meaning turns inward. Expansion pauses; vision incubates privately.

**MAP:**
Jupiter reversed. Stronger in 9th/12th. Dormant vector: worldview revision.

**VOICE:**
You may feel **expansion unsanctioned outwardly**, yet inner belief systems undergo renewal. Faith grows through personal resonance rather than cultural scripts.

**Balance Meter Climate:**

* Pressure: moderate 🌋
* Scaffolding: partial, inward
* Resilience: resilient if honored, depleted if denied
* Valence: 🌗 mixed → 💎 lift

**Vector Tag:** Dormant (inner calling awaiting external alignment).

**SST:** WB: inward faith clarified; ABE: cynicism before vision; OSR: expansion flows normally.

---

## **Saturn Retrograde**

**FIELD:**
Boundary force folds inward. Weight of rules or time felt internally.

**MAP:**
Saturn reversed. Natal angles magnify. Suppressed vector: authority tested within.

**VOICE:**
You might notice **restriction heightened**—structures turning back on themselves. Agency feels **unsanctioned** unless grounded in self-defined rules.

**Balance Meter Climate:**

* Pressure: high ⏳
* Scaffolding: cut externally, built inward
* Resilience: resilient if self-discipline forms
* Valence: 🌑 restrictive → ⚖️ integration

**Vector Tag:** Suppressed under containment (inner authority construction).

**SST:** WB: authority internalized; ABE: exile or resistance; OSR: rules flow without friction.

---

## **Uranus Retrograde**

**FIELD:**
Electricity turns inward. Innovation sparks inside before outer expression.

**MAP:**
Uranus reversed. Natal ties to luminaries sharp. Latent vector: revolution contained.

**VOICE:**
You may feel **resonance restricted outward**, yet flashes of originality surge internally. Agency appears **unsanctioned** socially, but incubates future breakthroughs.

**Balance Meter Climate:**

* Pressure: moderate-high ⚡
* Scaffolding: absent outward, brewing inward
* Resilience: rebounds when expressed in safe bursts
* Valence: 🌑 restrictive → 🦋 liberation

**Vector Tag:** Latent conditional impulse (internal revolution).

**SST:** WB: inner flashes realign; ABE: rebellion erupts suddenly; OSR: no inward revolution noticed.

---

## **Neptune Retrograde**

**FIELD:**
Dream-field dissolves inward. Illusions collapse privately.

**MAP:**
Neptune reversed. Heightened in 12th/9th. Suppressed vector: imagination reoriented.

**VOICE:**
You may notice **resonance slipping into dissonance**—beliefs unravel, clarity sought inside. External inspiration feels **unsanctioned** until falsehoods fall away.

**Balance Meter Climate:**

* Pressure: moderate 🌫️
* Scaffolding: absent, fog dissolves supports
* Resilience: rebounds through inner clarity
* Valence: 🌑 restrictive → 🌊 flow

**Vector Tag:** Suppressed under containment (dissolution turned inward).

**SST:** WB: false illusions stripped; ABE: confusion or cynicism; OSR: inspiration unaffected.

---

## **Pluto Retrograde**

**FIELD:**
Underworld currents intensify. Deep pressure zones inside identity.

**MAP:**
Pluto reversed. Natal contacts to Sun/Moon critical. Dormant/suppressed vector: metamorphosis incubated.

**VOICE:**
You may sense **agency collapsing outward**, yet profound inner power restructuring. Outward moves feel **unsanctioned** while subterranean change builds.

**Balance Meter Climate:**

* Pressure: very high 🌋
* Scaffolding: absent outward, tectonic inward
* Resilience: depleted under denial, resilient under shadow work
* Valence: 🌑 restrictive → ⚖️ integration

**Vector Tag:** Dormant conditional impulse (deep transformation under inner tectonics).

**SST:** WB: inner purging visible later; ABE: crises misread; OSR: life continues smoothly.

## **Systemic Notes**

* **All retrogrades** are diagnostic, not predictive.
* Each functions as **latent/suppressed/dormant vectors** that may not appear outward but operate internally.
* **Probabilistic adjectives** (openness/restriction, supported/unsanctioned, resonance/dissonance) standardize climate language.
* **Balance Meter overlays** provide falsifiable weather bands (pressure, scaffolding, resilience, valence).
* **SST clauses** ensure resonance is only logged if lived.

Do you want me to stitch these into a **mirror-ready format** (like a Solo Mirror section with retrograde entries slotted as Polarity Cards), or keep them as a **standalone lexicon update**?
