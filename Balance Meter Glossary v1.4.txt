# Woven Map Glossary (Balance Meter) — v1.4

**Date:** October 9, 2025
**Version:** 5.0 Compliant

## Core Principles

### Semantic Reservation
*   The **"weather/climate"** metaphor is strictly reserved for symbolic activations (transits) and is never applied to natal charts or internal states.

### Differentiating Layers
*   The system meticulously separates the **Constitutional Layer** (natal blueprint) from the **Transient Activation** (symbolic weather). The Balance Meter measures only the latter.

### Geometric Purity
*   Every metric is a direct translation of aspect geometry. There are no meta-derivatives (e.g., `Coherence`, `Volatility`) or composite products (`SFD`).

## The Two Core Axes

**1. Magnitude ⚡ (0–5)**
*   **What it is:** The size or intensity of symbolic pressure.
*   **Principle:** Always neutral. It measures *how much* energy is present, not whether it helps or hinders.
*   **Scale (Poetic Neutral):**
    *   **0 — Latent:** Background rhythm.
    *   **1 — Murmur:** Subtle impressions, faint signals.
    *   **2 — Pulse:** Noticeable bursts.
    *   **3 — Stirring:** Clear activation, demanding attention.
    *   **4 — Convergence:** Multiple factors create concentrated weight.
    *   **5 — Threshold:** Chapter-defining intensity.

**2. Directional Bias ↗️↘️ (–5 to +5)**
*   **What it is:** The net directional "lean" of the symbolic pressure.
*   **Principle:** Directional, not moral. Both poles can be adaptive.
    *   **Positive (↗️):** Expansive, harmonizing, opening.
    *   **Negative (↘️):** Contractive, constraining, focusing.
    *   **Neutral (↔️):** A net-neutral balance of forces.
*   **Scale (Flavor Patterns):**
    *   **–5 / –4 — Collapse / Grind:** Maximum restrictive tilt; compression.
    *   **–3 / –2 — Friction / Contraction:** Constraining; narrowing options.
    *   **–1 — Drag:** Subtle headwind.
    *   **0 — Equilibrium:** Net-neutral tilt.
    *   **+1 — Lift:** Gentle tailwind.
    *   **+2 / +3 — Flow / Harmony:** Smooth, coherent progress.
    *   **+4 / +5 — Expansion / Liberation:** Peak openness; breakthroughs.

## Sources of Force

*   **🎯 Orb:** Closeness of contact (tighter is stronger).
*   **∠ Aspect:** Geometric angle (e.g., Square, Trine).
*   **🪐 Potency:** Weighting of the planets involved.
*   **📡 Resonance:** Amplification when aspects hit sensitive points (Sun, Moon, Angles).

## Output Schema (v5.0)

The official output for any Balance Meter v5.0 reading.

```json
{
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "magnitude": 4.5,
  "directional_bias": -2.3,
  "trace": [
    "Saturn square Sun (-1.8)",
    "Pluto opposition Mars (-1.5)",
    "Jupiter trine Venus (+0.9)"
  ]
}
```

*   **`magnitude`**: The 0-5 intensity score.
*   **`directional_bias`**: The -5 to +5 directional score.
*   **`trace`**: The "show-your-work" clause; an array of the top contributing aspects and their force contribution.

## Deprecated Terms (v1.x, v4.0)

The following terms are no longer part of the public Balance Meter model.

*   **`Volatility`**: Removed. The concept of "scatter" or "fragmentation" is now described narratively by the VOICE layer, informed by backstage diagnostics like `aspect_count`.
*   **`Coherence`**: Removed. This was the inverse of Volatility.
*   **`SFD (Support-Friction Differential)`**: Removed. This complex composite metric has been replaced by the purity of the two-axis model.
*   **`Valence`**: Renamed to **Directional Bias** to avoid moralistic ("good/bad") connotations.
*   **`Resilience & Depletion Layer`**: Removed. This complex add-on is deprecated in favor of the simplified core model.
