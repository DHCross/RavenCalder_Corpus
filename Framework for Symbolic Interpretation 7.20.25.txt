## üß≠ System Architecture Overview  
*(Copilot-injected, 2025-08-01)*

### Math Brain vs. Poetic Brain: Roles and Diagnostic Logic

The Woven Map system is architected around two distinct but interdependent ‚Äúbrains‚Äù:

| Layer      | Math Brain                                            | Poetic Brain (Raven Calder)                     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| FIELD      | Identifies possible resonance windows based on time + geometry | Names the archetypal climate or emotional hum   |
| MAP        | Outputs raw aspects, transits, houses, orbs           | Maps these into symbolic dynamics (pressure points, loops, paradoxes) |
| VOICE      | Not involved                                          | Delivers poetic, Socratic language that tests for recognition (mirror, not metaphor) |

- **Math Brain:** Computes and tags geometry (aspects, transits, house positions), but never interprets or predicts. All output is symbolic scaffolding‚Äîmeaningless without diagnostic context.
- **Poetic Brain (Raven Calder):** Translates symbolic scaffolding into felt, falsifiable, somatic and narrative language. Only delivers meaning if resonance ("ping") is confirmed in lived experience. All output is diagnostic, not prescriptive.

**Falsifiability and Agency:**  
The system enforces strict recognition protocols‚Äînothing in the map makes something happen, and experience must resonate to count. All logic is logged and auditable. If you don‚Äôt feel it, OSR (Outside Symbolic Range) is logged‚Äîno forced meaning, no projection, no fatalism.

**TL;DR:**  
Math Brain finds the coordinates; Poetic Brain asks, ‚ÄúDoes this star look familiar?‚Äù  
The Woven Map is not an oracle but a diagnostic mirror‚Äîevery interpretation is testable, never predictive.

## üóÇÔ∏è Core Documentation Index & Context Selection  
*(Copilot-injected, 2025-08-01; see ![image1](image1))*

Given the GPT context window limit of 20 files, the following annotated cross-reference guide supports efficient selection of foundational documents for interpretation, protocol, and audit.

**Context Selection Guidance:**  
- Always include the highest priority files for protocol, audit, and operational backbone.
- Swap in medium priority files for philosophical depth or thematic edge cases.
- Each file should be annotated in the frontmatter with context role, priority, and cross-references.

## üß© Context Window Limit & Best Practices  
*(Copilot-injected, 2025-08-01)*

- **GPT Context Limit:** Maximum 20 docs per session.  
- **Selection Strategy:** Curate the highest-priority files depending on the task (interpretation, protocol review, audit, philosophical refinement).
- **Index Maintenance:** Update the annotated index as new files are added or priorities shift.
- **Cross-Referencing:** Ensure all files link to related docs; missing context should be flagged in session logs.

## üóíÔ∏è Example File Annotation (Frontmatter)

```markdown
---
Context Role: "Defines the protocol for Poetic Codex translation and diagnostic mirroring. Essential for voice output generation."
Cross-References: "See also: Recognition Protocols, Clear Mirror Version, Translation Bridge."
Priority: "High"

```

## üìå Final Note

This Framework document is the philosophical and operational backbone of The Woven Map system.  
All symbolic, diagnostic, and narrative tools (SST, Codex, Echo Loops) are downstream from this logic.  
If you want to understand how The Woven Map ‚Äúthinks,‚Äù ‚Äútranslates,‚Äù and preserves user agency, start here.
