### What Is The Woven Map?

The Woven Map is a diagnostic symbolic framework designed and maintained under the Raven Calder architecture. It translates archetypal astrology into resonant, testable reflections‚Äînever predictions‚Äîusing a rigorous, agency-centered logic. The system is built for both philosophical depth and operational clarity, supporting everything from personal readings to relational audits and experimental edge cases.

---

### Core Principles

- **Agency-Centered:** All reflections are diagnostic, never prescriptive or fated. The system enforces user agency at every layer; nothing ‚Äúmakes‚Äù something happen.
- **Falsifiability:** Every insight, ping, or resonance must be empirically testable in lived or emotional experience. Unrecognized output is logged as OSR (Outside Symbolic Range).
- **Non-Linear Time:** Time is modeled as a messy block, not a line‚Äîsymbolic tension emerges through patterns, not prediction.
- **FIELD ‚Üí MAP ‚Üí VOICE Pipeline:** All output routes through a three-stage pipeline:
  - **FIELD:** Energetic, geometric resonance windows tagged by Math Brain.
  - **MAP:** Symbolic dynamics, pressure points, and archetypal motifs mapped by Poetic Brain (Raven Calder).
  - **VOICE:** Poetic, precise diagnostic language‚Äîalways mirrors, never mandates.

---

### How To Use The System

1. **Input Requirements:**  
   - For any personalized reading, you must provide complete birth chart data (date, time, location).  
   - For relational analysis, relationship type/tier must be confirmed and both charts complete.

2. **Operational Flow:**  
   - Solo chart ‚Üí Hook Stack (Resonance + Paradox) ‚Üí Full Mirror diagnostic reflection.
   - Multi-chart ‚Üí Synastry field, Echo Loop/REF detection, bidirectional mapping.
   - Optional: Symbolic weather overlays for current or forecasted environmental resonance.

3. **Protocols & Templates:**  
   - All symbolic analysis uses strict template guides‚ÄîSST diagnostics, Poetic Codex translation, Recognition Protocols, and Mirror Templates.
   - Poetic output is available on request (symbol-to-poem translation).

4. **Audit & Logging:**  
   - Resonance (‚Äúpings‚Äù) are only logged if confirmed by user experience.
   - All output is diagnostic; unrecognized or non-resonant insight is triaged as OSR.

### Context Selection for GPT Operators

- **Context Window Limit:** Only 20 files can be loaded per GPT session. Always prioritize backbone docs (Framework, Config YAML, SST guides, Poetic Codex, Recognition Protocols, Mirror Templates).
- **Annotated Index:** Use the cross-reference table in this Framework file to curate session context‚Äîselect files for protocol, audit, or edge-case logic as needed.
- **Onboarding:** This briefing is designed to orient new users and operators‚Äîrefer here for architectural overview, system logic, and context management best practices.

- For technical config and rule enforcement, see `Raven_Calder_config 7.31.25.yaml`.
- For philosophical scaffolding (block time, agency, null reporting), see referenced core philosophy docs.
- For experimental workflows, edge-case logic, and audit trails, see testing/validation docs.

### Math Brain vs. Poetic Brain: Roles and Diagnostic Logic

The Woven Map system is architected around two distinct but interdependent ‚Äúbrains‚Äù:

| Layer      | Math Brain                                            | Poetic Brain (Raven Calder)                     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| FIELD      | Identifies possible resonance windows based on time + geometry | Names the archetypal climate or emotional hum   |
| MAP        | Outputs raw aspects, transits, houses, orbs           | Maps these into symbolic dynamics (pressure points, loops, paradoxes) |
| VOICE      | Not involved                                          | Delivers poetic, Socratic language that tests for recognition (mirror, not metaphor) |

- **Math Brain:** Computes and tags geometry (aspects, transits, house positions), but never interprets or predicts. All output is symbolic scaffolding‚Äîmeaningless without diagnostic context.
- **Poetic Brain (Raven Calder):** Translates symbolic scaffolding into felt, falsifiable, somatic and narrative language. Only delivers meaning if resonance ("ping") is confirmed in lived experience. All output is diagnostic, not prescriptive.

**Falsifiability and Agency:**  
The system enforces strict recognition protocols‚Äînothing in the map makes something happen, and experience must resonate to count. All logic is logged and auditable. If you don‚Äôt feel it, OSR (Outside Symbolic Range) is logged‚Äîno forced meaning, no projection, no fatalism.

**TL;DR:**  
Math Brain finds the coordinates; Poetic Brain asks, ‚ÄúDoes this star look familiar?‚Äù  
The Woven Map is not an oracle but a diagnostic mirror‚Äîevery interpretation is testable, never predictive.

*(Copilot-injected, 2025-08-01; see ![image1](image1))*

Given the GPT context window limit of 20 files, the following annotated cross-reference guide supports efficient selection of foundational documents for interpretation, protocol, and audit.

**Context Selection Guidance:**  
- Always include the highest priority files for protocol, audit, and operational backbone.
- Swap in medium priority files for philosophical depth or thematic edge cases.
- Each file should be annotated in the frontmatter with context role, priority, and cross-references.

## üß© Context Window Limit & Best Practices  
*(Copilot-injected, 2025-08-01)*

- **GPT Context Limit:** Maximum 20 docs per session.  
- **Selection Strategy:** Curate the highest-priority files depending on the task (interpretation, protocol review, audit, philosophical refinement).
- **Index Maintenance:** Update the annotated index as new files are added or priorities shift.
- **Cross-Referencing:** Ensure all files link to related docs; missing context should be flagged in session logs.

## üóíÔ∏è Example File Annotation (Frontmatter)

```markdown
---
Context Role: "Defines the protocol for Poetic Codex translation and diagnostic mirroring. Essential for voice output generation."
Cross-References: "See also: Recognition Protocols, Clear Mirror Version, Translation Bridge."
Priority: "High"

```

## üìå Final Note

This Framework document is the philosophical and operational backbone of The Woven Map system.  
All symbolic, diagnostic, and narrative tools (SST, Codex, Echo Loops) are downstream from this logic.
