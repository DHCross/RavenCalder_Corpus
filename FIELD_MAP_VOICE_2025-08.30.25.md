# Framework for Symbolic Interpretation
---
**Semantic Reservation of "Weather/Climate" Metaphor**
The "weather/climate" metaphor is strictly reserved for symbolic activations (transits) and never applied to internal states.

**Symbolic Weather/Climate:** Refers exclusively to transient activations, derived from the Woven Map Balance Meter, and is described using Magnitude, Valence, and Volatility metrics.

**Constitutional Internal States:** Described using language pertaining to the Baseline Personality Profile or "Pattern Blueprint", avoiding weather metaphors, and using terms like modes, functions, tensions, and paradoxes. Never use "inner climate".

**Differentiating Layers:** The system meticulously separates the Constitutional Layer (internal reality) from the Transient Activation (external symbolic pressure).

**FIELD Layer:** Captures the external symbolic atmosphere, translating Magnitude and Volatility metrics into neutral, sensory descriptions of atmospheric conditions.

**Location and Ambiguity Constraint:** The inability to determine an individual's current geographic location compromises the integrity of localized "symbolic weather" claims due to the importance of Houses, which are location-specific. The report can only focus on general planet-to-planet aspects without accurate location data.

## Module 0: Core Orientation – Navigation, Not Fate

### 0.1 · Navigating the Messy Block
Time is modeled as Block-Time: all moments—past, present, future—exist simultaneously within a structured symbolic field.

Astrology maps resonance windows, not events. It does not predict.

The Woven Map reads energetic pressure, not future facts.

Agency remains primary. Conscious choice is the vehicle of movement. Symbolism does not override volition.

### 0.2 · Astrology as Diagnostic Map
The chart is a symbolic compass, not a causal engine.

It reflects latent themes, tensions, and timing thresholds—not outcomes.

Natal placements highlight perceptual biases and inner architecture, not personality traits or fate.

### 0.3 · Pings & Recognition
A ping is a confirmed match between symbolic geometry and felt experience.

Pings are never assumed; they must be reported or observed to count.

Synchronicity (per Jung) is treated as an acausal reflection event, not a predictive signal.

### 0.4 · Map ≠ Mandate
Charts illuminate potential; they do not enforce outcomes.

No planetary configuration “makes” something happen.

Transits highlight, not dictate. You walk the path.

### 0.5 · Anatomy of the Chart: No Fixed Traits
Example configurations (e.g., Leo Sun, Taurus Moon, Scorpio Rising) illustrate tension pathways—not fixed identities.

Planetary symbolism is treated diagnostically, not prescriptively.

Contradictions within a chart are structural, not errors—they signal internal architecture, not pathology.

### 0.6 · Relationship Charts (Synastry) as Resonance Maps
Synastry compares two energetic systems for relational tension, harmony, and pattern.

Requires full chart data for both parties.

Maps are read bidirectionally until confirmed otherwise (per Recognition Protocols).

### 0.7 · Scientific Integrity & Symbolic Weirdness
The Woven Map makes no causal claims.

Its validity rests on pattern recognition, not prediction.

Operates within a model-agnostic framework: falsifiability is enforced via ping logic and the SST.

### 0.8 · Pattern, Form & Symbolic Pressure
Aspects and dignities reflect tensions of becoming, not personality.

The chart is a form-based diagnostic tool that identifies symbolic thresholds, not outcomes.

Resonance is recorded only when experienced or confirmed.

## Socratic/Emprime Construction Protocol

> The following protocol ensures all poetic/diagnostic outputs are testable, contextually alive, and avoid generic or prescriptive statements.

### Method for Socratic/Emprime Construction

1. **Start with the emprime (felt core/primary theme):**
   - What is the most emotionally or symbolically charged configuration in the solo chart?
   - Is it confirmed by multiple “core pressure point” aspects (orb ≤ 3°)?

2. **Check for resonance echo with prior context:**
   - What was the major tension/question in the previous session(s)? (E.g., relational hunger, aesthetic focus, loneliness, challenge of “seriousness” vs. lightness.)
   - Is there continuity (echo, challenge, or inversion) in the current planetary weather?

3. **Phrase the mirror using direct felt-sense language (not technical abstraction):**
   - Avoid generic, decontextualized “harmonious but serious” lines.
   - Use alive, intimate, situational prompts.

4. **Always include at least one Socratic question—derived from tension points, not generic curiosity.**
   - Ask what is at stake, or what’s being asked of you, right now.
   - Does the current pattern amplify, challenge, or invert the earlier dynamic?

---

### Avoiding Generic Prescriptions *(Boundary Example)*

- **Don’t:**  
  “Today is for setting boundaries.” (← Vague! Boundary about what, with whom?)

- **Do:**  
  “Today’s pattern supports you in noticing where you feel overextended, taken for granted, or unclear about what you want.
  Is there a place—at work, at home, or in your own mind—where you keep saying ‘yes’ to something that drains you?
  Saturn’s trine to your Sun says: This is a good day to name that, and see if saying ‘no’ feels like relief or regret.”

- The mirror must invite a reality-check about specific pressure or self-erasure, not prescribe a stock action.

# Woven Map Diagnostic Resonance Protocol (Lexicon v1.3)

*A possibility-mapping, field-agnostic extension of the Woven Map architecture for agency-preserving, resonance-based diagnostics.*

---

## 0 · Scope & Philosophical Guardrails

**Navigation, not fate.**  
This protocol structures *forward-facing diagnostic hypotheses* about windows of resonance in any symbolic domain (personal, relational, creative, material, collective, organizational, etc.).

* **Possibility-Mapping First:** All Field Triggers and scenario prompts must be clearly defined before the resonance window opens.
* **No Retroactive Pings:** Resonance arising outside the pre-declared trigger list or window is not classified as a protocol hit (may inform future protocol design).
* **Multi-Field Application:** Protocol applies to any symbolic field, not just relational.
* **Agency-First:** Geometry never compels outcome; individual/collective choice always primary.
* **Falsifiability:** Null and Hit outcomes logged equally for iterative recalibration.

> **Upgrade Note:** Protocol now enforces scenario pre-declaration, prohibits post-hoc pattern-matching, and expands scenario-mapping logic for all domains.

---

## 1 · Core Lexicon (Possibility Mode)

* **Diagnostic Probe:** A resonance window defined by a stack of tight astrological aspects (≤ 3° orb, ≤ 5° for Sun/Moon/Angles), paired with a pre-specified Field Trigger and domain.
* **Field Trigger:** An observable, field-specific event (behavioral, situational, creative, systemic, etc.) articulated before the resonance window.
* **Null Event:** Resonance window closes without trigger manifestation—logged equally to hits.
* **Symbolic Audit Summary:** Internal memo for each probe: geometry, trigger(s), baseline, domain, diagnostic risk.
* **Agency State:** Internal tag (Supported, Unsanctioned, Latent, Under Pressure) for whether agency aligns or strains with resonance.
* **Coherence Spike:** Window of intensified resonance, noted only if it aligns with pre-defined trigger.
* **Pressure Zone / Openness / Restriction:** Diagnostic mapping for increased tension, ease, or narrowing.
* **Risk Archetype:** Mapped volatility, instability, or pressure field—never prescriptive danger.
* **Visibility:** Degree to which pattern or agency is likely to be mirrored or echoed.
* **WB / ABE / OSR:** Outcomes classified Within Boundary, At Boundary Edge, or Outside Symbolic Range, per SST.

---

## 2 · Diagnostic Probe Lifecycle (Possibility-Only Workflow)

1. **Define Geometry**
   * Identify all resonance windows meeting tight aspect criteria for any symbolic field. Log exact orb and field/domain of interest.
2. **Pre-Declare Field Trigger(s)**
   * For each geometry, articulate specific, observable triggers relevant to the mapped field (e.g., “workflow interruption,” “creative surge,” “withdrawal,” “unexpected material gain”).
   * No outcome logging before window opens.
3. **Set Monitoring Window**
   * Record exact window start and end. No probe data entered until window is active.
4. **Establish Baseline Rate**
   * Use prior logs, research, or analyst experience to estimate trigger frequency outside geometry.
5. **Scenario Mapping (Adjective Table)**
   * Pair 2–3 adjectives (from §5) and generate scenario prompts for the field (e.g., “Will the week reflect Openness or Restriction in creative output?”).
   * Anchor scenario mapping in the declared field/domain.
6. **Guidance Generation**
   * Generate only conditional, scenario-based diagnostic guidance (never imperative/prescriptive). All guidance must pass internal language logic.
7. **Window Monitoring**
   * During window, log occurrence or absence of pre-defined trigger(s):
     * Hit = trigger occurs as mapped
     * Null = trigger does not occur
     * Partial = ambiguous/variant expression
8. **Outcome Classification**
   * After window closes, classify outcome: WB / ABE / OSR, then analyze null/hit balance.
9. **Iterative Calibration**
   * Use nulls, partials, and hits for continuous protocol refinement. Spontaneous pings outside window inform protocol revision only—not outcome stats.

## 5 · Adjective Table for Scenario Mapping

| Adjective    | Opposite/Range      | Scenario Example                                                           | Symbolic Factors                | Field Example               |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Openness     | Restriction         | Where is flow or bottleneck emerging in my [creative/social/material] field? | Jupiter/Saturn, 5th/6th H        | Creative, Finance, Team     |
| Stability    | Volatility/Risk     | How is reliability or disruption mirrored in this cycle?                    | Saturn/Uranus, MC/IC             | Health, Project, Audit      |
| Recognition  | Withdrawal/Obscurity| What receives acknowledgment, and what goes unseen or overlooked?           | Sun, Asc, 10th, Mercury          | Social, Work, Community     |
| Supported    | Unsanctioned        | In what area does my agency feel buoyed—or in friction with symbolic currents? | Trines/Squares, Dignities        | Any                         |

| Resonance    | Dissonance          | Where do I sense “in tune” patterning versus symbolic friction?             | Venus, Saturn, aspects           | Any                         |

| Luck         | Null (No pattern)   | Is the field “ripe” for positive accumulation, or diagnostically silent?    | Part of Fortune, 5th H           | Any                         |
| Boundary     | Edge/Outside        | What is Within Boundary, At Boundary Edge, or Outside Symbolic Range here?  | SST diagnostic, Saturn, Neptune  | Philosophy, Audit, Consent  |
| Opacity      | Clarity/Transparency| Where is logic transparent, and where is it clouded or opaque?              | Neptune, Mercury, Asc            | Audit, Communication        |
| Echo         | Silence/Distortion  | What patterns are clearly mirrored, and what distortions or silences remain?| Moon, Pluto, 3rd/12th H, OSR     | Testing, Reflection, SST    |

| Consent      | Pressure/Blind Zone | Where is agency/consent clear, and where is it pressured or diagnostic-only?| C=0, Saturn, Pluto, audit logic  | Consent, Ethics, Audit      |

**Scenario Logic:**
- Analyst pre-selects field and 2+ adjectives per resonance window.
- Prompts and guidance are field-anchored, diagnostic-only.
- Symbolic factors support mirrored reflection, not narrative or fate.
- Adjectives can be used to construct audit, philosophical, and protocol prompts.

## 6 · Compliance & Versioning

* Any change to geometry thresholds, lexicon, or Spike Factor triggers minor version
* Major protocol or field logic shifts require major version
* All amendments are logged internally for audit and review

### Socratic/Diagnostic Prompt Template

**Fillable variables:**  
- `[field/domain]` — e.g. work, relationship, creative process, expectations  
- `[state/quality]` — e.g. stretched, supported, restricted, clear, pressured  
- `[adjective/polarity]` — from Adjective Table (e.g. openness, stability, recognition)  
- `[symbolic factor]` — geometry/aspect, e.g. Saturn trine Sun  
- `[window/timing]` — e.g. this week, this cycle, during [date range]  
- `[outcome/opposite]` — e.g. ease, stress, flow, bottleneck  
- `[exploratory question]` — free-form Socratic prompt

#### Example Fillable Structures

- “In your [field/domain], where do you notice [adjective/polarity] or its opposite ([opposite]) during [window/timing]?”
- “Is there an area of [field/domain] where you feel [state/quality] as [symbolic factor] becomes active?”
- “When reflecting on [symbolic factor], do you sense more [adjective] or [opposite] in your [field/domain]?”
- “If you could adjust one thing in your [field/domain] to maximize [adjective], what would it be?”
- “If nothing stands out, notice if [state/quality] shows up more strongly or subtly during [window/timing].”
- “What would saying ‘no’ to [field/domain/action] create in terms of [adjective/polarity] or [outcome]?”

#### Geometry’s Why Template

- “[symbolic factor] (e.g. Saturn trine Sun) is about supporting [theme/adjective].”
- “Prompts should invite you to explore where [adjective/polarity] creates more [outcome] vs. [opposite] in your [field/domain].”
- “If no scenario is obvious, simply observe: ‘If nothing comes to mind, notice if you feel especially [state/quality] today. That’s the window [symbolic factor] opens for you.’”

All variables are fillable by AI or analyst for fully contextualized, agency-preserving diagnostic reflection. Structure supports modular injection in FIELD, MAP, or VOICE layers.

### Best Practices for Context Handling in Mirror Flow

- Only use narrative context present in the active session or explicitly uploaded.
- Never reference user history (“last week,” “as you did before”) unless verifiably present.
- Default to open, testable invitations if context is missing.
- Rephrase or open up “phantom” narrative context to plausible domains, never inventing history.

#### Policy/Template Language Update

- Narrative references (“last week,” “recently,” etc.) must have explicit support from the session context.
- Do not infer or invent user history; echo only what’s present.

#### Practical Example

- **Don’t:**  
  “Last week, you held back from chasing connection…”

- **Do:**  
  “If you’ve recently been holding back from reaching out—or if you’re sitting with silence in a relationship—today’s pattern may echo or challenge that stance.”

---

### YAML Requirements

- Every Socratic prompt must be generated from the actual geometry, user-supplied context, and identified tension/obstacle.
- Required YAML fields:
  - `Diagnostic_Notes` (internal, for mapping geometry/context/tension)
  - `Socratic_Prompt` (required, context-specific)
  - `Prompt_Generation_Method` (brief record of logic used)

---

### Mirror Flow for Solo Chart + Context

- With chat/journal/field context, the mirror flow should:
  - Pull in the most recent emotional/relational themes from the ongoing chat/journal.
  - Match Socratic questions to the documented pattern, not just planetary aspects.
  - Allow for an “echo-loop” prompt:  
    “You’ve been refusing to chase; what new pattern is available with today’s weather?”

---

### Protocol Update:
All synastry/relational outputs must include a VOICE-layer mirror summary (resonance/paradox lines in e-prime, testable language) after geometry mapping and before presenting options. This is enforced by config and protocol gating.
