Woven Map Glossary (Balance Meter) — v1.3
---
**Semantic Reservation of "Weather/Climate" Metaphor**
The "weather/climate" metaphor is strictly reserved for symbolic activations (transits) and never applied to internal states.

**Symbolic Weather/Climate:** Refers exclusively to transient activations, derived from the Woven Map Balance Meter, and is described using Magnitude, Valence, and Volatility metrics.

**Constitutional Internal States:** Described using language pertaining to the Baseline Personality Profile or "Pattern Blueprint", avoiding weather metaphors, and using terms like modes, functions, tensions, and paradoxes. Never use "inner climate".

**Differentiating Layers:** The system meticulously separates the Constitutional Layer (internal reality) from the Transient Activation (external symbolic pressure).

**FIELD Layer:** Captures the external symbolic atmosphere, translating Magnitude and Volatility metrics into neutral, sensory descriptions of atmospheric conditions.

**Location and Ambiguity Constraint:** The inability to determine an individual's current geographic location compromises the integrity of localized "symbolic weather" claims due to the importance of Houses, which are location-specific. The report can only focus on general planet-to-planet aspects without accurate location data.
Core Dimensions
Magnitude ⚡ (0–5) Size of symbolic pressure. Always neutral: how much energy is present, not whether it helps or hinders. Capped 0–5 for comparability and falsifiability.

Valence 🌞🌑🌗 (−5…+5) Tilt of that pressure. • 🌞 Positive (supportive): harmonizes, stabilizes, opens pathways. • 🌑 Negative (restrictive): constrains, destabilizes, blocks. • 🌗 Mixed: simultaneous support and strain near 0; use ⚖️ Equilibrium for exact 0. Rule: Compare days by number first; emoji refines texture, not rank.

Volatility 🔀 (0–5, ascending only) Distribution shape (coherence → scatter), independent of tone. Low = coherent channel (single center of gravity; may appear as one strike or a sustained pull). High = scatter (many small, uncoordinated contacts). Header remains “🔀 Volatility.” 🌀 appears only at level 5.

SFD (Support–Friction Differential) Verdict layer: splits pressure into supportive (S+) vs. frictional (S−). • Discrete: SFD_disc ∈ {+1, 0, −1} • Continuous: SFD_cont = scale_to[−1,+1](S+ − S−) • Stabilizers_t: norm01(max(0, SFD_cont))


⚡ Magnitude (0 … 5) — Poetic Neutral
0 — Latent: not measurable; background rhythm; potential without expression
1 — Murmur: subtle impressions, faint signals
2 — Pulse: noticeable bursts (often Mercury/Venus/Mars triggers)
3 — Stirring: clear activation; events/shifts/demands surface
4 — Convergence: multiple stacked factors; concentrated weight
5 — Threshold: chapter‑defining, not inherently catastrophic

Magnitude is intensity‑only; never “good/bad.”


🔀 Volatility (0 → 5) — Glyph Ladder
0 — ➿ Aligned Flow: signals cohered, single channel
1–2 — 🔄 Cycled Pull: stable repeats, predictable rhythm
2–3 — 🔀 Mixed Paths: split distribution; neither steady nor chaotic
3–4 — 🧩 Fragment Scatter: threads split apart; uneven strikes
5 — 🌀 Vortex Dispersion: extreme scatter; no clear center


🌑🌞 Valence Mapping (−5 … +5)
Anchors & Flavor Patterns
−5 — Collapse 🌋🧩⬇️ — maximum restrictive tilt; compression / failure points
−4 — Grind 🕰⚔🌪 — sustained resistance; heavy duty load
−3 — Friction ⚔🌊🌫 — conflicts or cross‑purposes slow motion
−2 — Contraction 🌫🧩⬇️ — narrowing options; ambiguity or energy drain
−1 — Drag 🌪🌫 — subtle headwind; minor loops or haze
0 — ⚖️ Equilibrium — net‑neutral tilt; forces cancel or are too diffuse to resolve
+1 — Lift 🌱✨ — gentle tailwind; beginnings sprout
+2 — Flow 🌊🧘 — smooth adaptability; things click
+3 — Harmony 🧘✨🌊 — coherent progress; both/and solutions
+4 — Expansion 💎🔥🦋 — widening opportunities; clear insight fuels growth
+5 — Liberation 🦋🌈🔥 — peak openness; breakthroughs / big‑sky view
Emoji Selection Rules
Choose emojis from the patterns above based on what resonates with the specific energy signature. Use 1–2 emojis if Mag ≤ 2; up to 3 if Mag ≥ 3. Never mix negative and positive emojis in one day; 🌀 never appears in Valence (reserved for Volatility extreme).




🎯∠🪐📡♾️ Sources of Force
🎯 Orb — closeness of contact (closer = stronger)
∠ Aspect — geometric angle (majors thunder, minors whisper)
🪐 Potency — planetary speed/mass (slower = tectonic, faster = sparks)
📡 Resonance — amplification when hitting Sun, Moon, ASC, MC, Nodes
♾️ Recursion — repeated/overlapping themes echo louder

Glyph integrity: 🌀 only = Vol 5 · 🌫 only = Valence Fog/Dissolution · ∠ only = Aspect · ⚡ is always 0–5 neutral.


Resilience & Depletion Layer (Add‑On; Chart‑Agnostic)
Drop‑in module; works with any chart/date range without altering core channels.
Inputs (per day t)
Required (symbolic) Mag_t ∈ [0,5] — magnitude/intensity Val_t ∈ [−5,+5] — signed valence SFD_disc ∈ {+1, 0, −1} and/or SFD_cont ∈ [−1,+1]

Optional (physiology; rolling 60‑day baselines, fallback 30‑day if sparse) HRV_t, RestHR_t, SleepTot_t, SleepFrag_t, Mood_t(−1..+1) → z‑scores zHRV_t = (HRV_t − μ_HRV)/σ_HRV, zHR_t = (RestHR_t − μ_HR)/σ_HR, etc.

Defaults (windows & percentiles) V_neg = 35th percentile of last 60 days (fallback 30) Load_hi = 75th percentile of Load over same window
Step 1 — Stress Event (forge)
Stress_t = 1 if (Mag_t ≥ M_hi) and (Val_t ≤ V_neg) else 0 Defaults: M_hi = 4.0, V_neg = p35(60d)
Step 2 — Load Accumulator (what the week cost)
Load_t = γ·Load_{t−1} + (Mag_t · neg(Val_t)) with γ = 0.6–0.8, neg(Val)=max(0, −Val) Edge‑case guard (optional): when Vol_t ≥ 4, weight fragmented restrictors: Mag_t · neg(Val_t) · (1 + Vol_t/5) (disabled by default; enable only for 🧩/🌀 days)
Step 3 — Rebound Detection (1–2 day window)
Hybrid (with health): Rebound_{t+1}=1 if (zHRV_{t+1} ≥ +θ_h ∧ zHR_{t+1} ≤ −θ_h) or (Mood_{t+1} − μ_Mood ≥ +θ_m) else 0 Defaults: θ_h = 0.3–0.5, θ_m = 0.15 Grace: check again at t+2.

Symbolic‑only proxy: ProxyRebound_{t+1}=1 if (Mag_{t+1} ≤ M_mid) and (SFD_cont ≥ +0.15) else 0 Default: M_mid ≈ 3.0
Step 4 — Immediate Recovery Index (per stress event)
If Stress_t = 1: • Hybrid: Recovery_t = max(Rebound_{t+1..t+2}) • Symbolic: Recovery_t = max(ProxyRebound_{t+1..t+2}) Else: Recovery_t = null
Step 5 — Rolling Resilience Score
Resilience_t = EMA(Recovery over recent Stress events, span = 5 events) → 0..1 Report only after ≥ 3 stress events to avoid early wobble. Interpretation: ≥0.66 fast reset · 0.33–0.66 mixed · <0.33 slow
Step 6 — Depletion (quiet ≠ stable)
Hybrid (preferred):

QuietWithWeight_t = 1 if (Mag_t ≤ M_low) and (Val_t ≤ V_neg) and (SFD_disc ≤ 0) else 0

PhysioDebt_t = norm01( w_h·max(0, −zHRV_t) + w_r·max(0, zHR_t) + w_s·SleepDebt_t + w_m·max(0, −(Mood_t − μ_Mood)) )

DepletionIndex_t = clamp( a·QuietWithWeight_t + b·norm01(Load_t) + c·PhysioDebt_t − d·Stabilizers_t, 0, 1 )

Stabilizers_t = norm01(max(0, SFD_cont))

Defaults: M_low ≈ 3.0; weights a=b=c=0.3, d=0.2; w_h=w_r=w_s=w_m equal to start.

Symbolic‑only fallback: DepletionFlag_t = 1 if (Mag_t ≤ M_low) ∧ (Val_t ≤ V_neg) ∧ (SFD_disc ≤ 0) ∧ (Load_{t−1} ≥ Load_hi) else 0
Step 7 — Outputs (daily)
Resilience_t (0..1) — rolling bounce‑back capacity
Recovery_t (0/1) — per‑event rebound flag
DepletionIndex_t (0..1) + confidence ∈ {"hybrid","symbolic"}
Narrative (one sentence): plain, falsifiable, non‑predictive

Narrative templates

Rebound noted: “High strain yesterday; today shows rebound markers and stronger stabilizers—fast reset signature.”
No rebound: “Strain yesterday, no bounce yet—system still carrying load; reset looks slower.”
Quiet ≠ stable: “Low intensity with restrictive tilt and prior load—energy may feel thin; more grind than crisis.”

Sanity Checks (falsifiable)
Monthly, days with ⚡ ≥ 4 & Val ≤ −2 should explain ≥ 80% of Stress_t = 1. If not, retune M_hi/V_neg.
Resilience_t should correlate positively with next‑day SFD_cont after stress (ρ > 0.25 in a rolling 60‑day window).
DepletionIndex should rarely exceed 0.7 on days with Mag ≥ 4 (that’s active strain, not “quiet ≠ stable”). If it does, tighten your quiet logic.


Frame
Map, not mandate. The Balance Meter keeps Magnitude neutral, Valence directional, Volatility distributive, and SFD evaluative. Even at ⚡5 — Threshold, ballast can mean strain with beams, not free fall.
