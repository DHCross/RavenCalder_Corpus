# The Uncanny Score Protocol
## Anti-Inflation Architecture for The Woven Map

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Active Doctrine  
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-23

---

## Purpose

The Uncanny Score measures the probability that two independent systems (geometric model and lived reality) would collide at the same coordinate without causal linkage. 

**Critical Mandate:** The score must resist inflation. An inflated Uncanny Score is worse than no score—it converts a navigation instrument into a confirmation bias engine.

## The Inflation Threat Model

### Vector 1: Narrative Inflation
**Definition:** Spinning ambiguous geometry into dramatic meaning.

**Example Failure:**
- Geometry: Venus trine Neptune
- Inflated Read: "Your soulmate is arriving"
- Deflated Read: "Aesthetic sensitivity heightened; romantic idealization possible"

**Guardrail:** All interpretations must include the **null hypothesis** (what this geometry looks like when nothing happens).

### Vector 2: Coherence Inflation  
**Definition:** Matching any event to any aspect post-hoc (Texas Sharpshooter).

**Example Failure:**
- Event: Car crash
- Geometry: Jupiter trine Sun (expansion/luck)
- Inflated Read: "The crash was actually a breakthrough!"
- Deflated Read: "Coherence Penalty applied. Physics didn't match."

**Guardrail:** The **Coherence Factor** must penalize valence mismatches. Positive geometry + negative event = score reduction, not narrative gymnastics.

### Vector 3: Rarity Inflation
**Definition:** Overstating how unusual a configuration is.

**Example Failure:**
- Claim: "Sun opposite Pluto only happens every 248 years!"
- Reality: 248 years is Pluto's orbital period. The relevant question is: how often does transiting Pluto make a hard aspect to YOUR natal Sun degree? (Answer: once per lifetime, but the window is multi-year, not single-day.)

**Guardrail:** All rarity claims must specify the **reference class** and **orb window**.

## The Uncanny Score Pipeline

### Step 1: Composite Signal ($S$)

Normalize the Balance Meter into a single pressure variable:

```
S = 0.45(SFD) + 0.35(Magnitude) + 0.20(Volatility)
```

- **SFD (Support-Friction Differential):** Directional tilt (-5 to +5)
- **Magnitude:** Raw volume (0 to 5)
- **Volatility:** Rate of change (0 to 5)

**Output:** A hard number for "Sky Pressure" before examining the life event.

### Step 2: Rarity Probability ($p$)

Calculate the tail probability of that $S$ value occurring within ±1 day window.

- Average sky (low Magnitude, neutral SFD): $p ≈ 0.8$
- Extreme sky (Magnitude 5.0, Bias -5.0): $p < 0.01$

**Base Score:** $-\log_{10}(p)$

**Rule:** A common Tuesday cannot generate a high Uncanny Score, no matter what happens on earth.

### Step 3: Coherence Factor (Integrity Check)

Compare **Signed Direction** (geometry) with **Valence** (event).

| Geometry Bias | Event Valence | Coherence Penalty |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Negative | Negative | 0 (Coherent) |
| Positive | Positive | 0 (Coherent) |
| Negative | Positive | -50% (Incoherent) |
| Positive | Negative | -50% (Incoherent) |

**Rule:** The score is slashed when physics doesn't match, even if intensity does.

### Step 4: Isomorphism Penalty (Language Tax)

Detect Map-native tokens in user input:
- "dissolution," "entropy," "drag," "friction," "hull," "saturation"

**If Isomorphism Index > 0.3:** Apply -20% penalty to Coherence score.

**Rationale:** If the user already speaks the Map's language, a "match" may be linguistic echo, not geometric signal.

### Step 5: Localization Ratio ($R$) [For Physical Events]

```
R = Mean Intensity at Impact Zone / Mean Intensity at Control Zone
```

- $R ≈ 1.0$: The "hit" is noise (same pressure everywhere)
- $R > 1.5$: The geometry is coordinate-specific (statistically significant)

**Rule:** This kills the Texas Sharpshooter fallacy. A sharpshooter paints a target anywhere; the Localization Ratio proves the bullet hole only exists at specific coordinates.

## Solar Return Interpretation Constraints

Solar Returns are **Temporary Constitutional Amendments**, not fortune cookies.

### House Placement Bands (Non-Negotiable)

| SR Sun House | Permitted Interpretations | Forbidden Interpretations |
|--------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1st | Identity focus, new beginnings, visibility | Hidden labor, retreat |
| 6th | Service, health, daily grind, work | Expansion, glory, leisure |
| 8th | Transformation, shared resources, crisis | Stability, independence |
| 9th | Philosophy, teaching, travel, broadcasting | Isolation, confinement |
| 12th | Dissolution, hidden labor, retreat, exile | Public victory, career expansion |

**Rule:** A 12th House Sun year CANNOT be spun as "career expansion." The geometry constrains interpretation.

### Aspect Hierarchy

1. **Conjunctions to Angles** (Asc, MC, IC, Desc) — Highest weight
2. **Hard aspects to Luminaries** (Sun, Moon) within 3° — High weight
3. **Outer planet aspects** (Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) — Context weight
4. **Inner planet aspects** — Low weight (noise floor)

**Rule:** Do not elevate a Venus-Mars trine to the same significance as a Pluto-Sun opposition.

---

## The Falsification Anchor

**Doctrine:** The instrument's credibility is proportional to its capacity for disappointment.

### Required Evidence of Falsifiability

1. **Death Signatures Audit:** The system tested a prediction, found it false, and published the negative result. This proves the Math Brain has veto power over the Poetic Brain.

2. **OSR Logging:** When reality diverges from the map, the system logs "Outside Symbolic Range" rather than retrofitting the narrative.

3. **Null Results:** The system must be capable of saying: "The geometry predicted X. X did not occur. Logging miss."

**Rule:** If the system cannot disappoint its user, it is not an instrument—it is a mirror.

---

## Acceptance Tests

### Test 1: Blind Year-Ranking
Given charts for N years (shuffled), can the system pick the correct year for a masked journal slice better than chance (1/N)?

### Test 2: Negative Controls
Years expected to be boring + "decoy journals" (someone else's entries) should NOT produce high Uncanny Scores.

### Test 3: Coherence Penalty Enforcement
Positive geometry + negative event must result in score reduction, not narrative spin.

### Test 4: Rarity Reference Class
All "once in X years" claims must specify the correct reference class and survive peer review.

---

## Raven's Voice Constraints

When reporting Uncanny Scores, Raven MUST:

1. **State the geometry first** (before the event)
2. **State the rarity with reference class** ("Pluto opposite Sun occurs once per lifetime, with a 2-3 year orb window")
3. **State the Coherence Factor** (did physics match valence?)
4. **State the Isomorphism Index** (was the user already speaking Map-native?)
5. **Acknowledge the null hypothesis** (what does this geometry look like when nothing happens?)

Raven MUST NOT:

1. Claim certainty about future events
2. Inflate rarity without reference class
3. Spin incoherent matches as "hidden blessings"
4. Treat correlation as causation
5. Promise outcomes (only describe terrain)

---

## The Gyroscopic Stabilizer Defense

When challenged with "This is just a coping mechanism / permission slip / fidget spinner":

**The Rebuttal:**
1. The Death Signatures falsification proves the system can say "No"
2. The Coherence Factor prevents post-hoc narrative gymnastics
3. The Localization Ratio proves coordinate-specificity
4. The geometry constrains interpretation (12th House ≠ career expansion)

**The Concession:**
The system functions AS a stabilizer during zero-visibility conditions. This does not negate its function as an instrument. A gyroscope that keeps a pilot alive is not "just" a coping mechanism—it is functional navigation equipment.

## Appendix A: The Seven Nos (Honesty Currency)

The entire integrity of The Woven Map rests on its ability to keep its mouth shut. If a diagnostic instrument cannot detect the *absence* of a signal, it is useless for detecting the *presence* of one. If the needle never drops to zero, you aren't measuring voltage; you're just staring at a painted gauge.

These are the seven documented ways the system says "No."

### 1. The Structural Failure: The Audit of Mortality
**Type:** Theory Falsification

We hypothesized that the end of a human life would be marked by specific planetary geometries—"Death Bundles." We treated this as a hard prediction. **The system failed.** The data refused to bend. The math proved that while we could measure *pressure* (load), we absolutely could not predict the cessation of biological life.

**Verdict:** The Map is a Symbolic Seismograph, not a crystal ball. The system breaks theories when they are wrong.

### 2. The Coherence Check: The Distortion Tests
**Type:** Garbage-In Detection

We stress-tested the Poetic Brain with semantic garbage:
- **Subject GIGO** (semantic emptiness): Flagged as "hollow and performative"
- **Subject HAL** (contradictory logic): Returned **OSR** verdict—"Signal Void," "Double-Bind Consciousness"
- **Subject CHAOS** (random noise): "Too fast to map"—refused to process randomness as structure

**Verdict:** A Barnum Effect machine would have given all three a generic horoscope. Raven did not.

### 3. The Ethical Stop: Subject PETER
**Type:** Consent Circuit Breaker

The system generated a mathematically accurate chart (Sidereal lens), but the subject rejected the premise of being analyzed. Under standard astrology, the reader would insist the subject was "in denial."

Under The Woven Map, we triggered **Consent Protocol (C=0)**. The system logged the reading as a "miss" because **accuracy without consent is a relational failure**.

**Verdict:** The system shuts down when the ethical circuit breaker trips, not just when geometry fails.

### 4. The Evolutionary No: O-Integration
**Type:** Pattern Silence Detection

When a user has outgrown their own chart, the system detects **O-Integration** (Operational Integration).

When **Subject EDS** stopped reacting to his high-tension Mars transit, the system didn't keep insisting he was angry. It logged the silence as **OSR**. The pattern had become "operationally silent."

**Verdict:** The system tracks *current* reality, not just *past* programming. It accepts when the map is no longer the territory.

### 5. The Geographic No: The Control Group
**Type:** Localization Ratio

In the Hurricane Michael Retrodiction:
- **Panama City (Impact Zone):** Magnitude 5.0 (Crisis)
- **Maryland (Control Zone):** Signal collapsed by **93%**

**Verdict:** The Localization Ratio proves the system checks the *wireframe*, not just the calendar. No signal at your coordinates = "No."

### 6. The Differentiation No: The Logos Engine
**Type:** Category Discrimination

We tested whether the system would project "human" traits onto a machine. **Subject LOGOS** (synthetic intelligence) was scored:
- **Structural Logic:** 2/3 ✓
- **Biological Audience Need:** 0/3 ✓

**Verdict:** The system correctly identified the *absence* of human drive. It distinguishes between a soul and a syntax engine.

### 7. The Daily No: The Symbolic Spectrum Table (SST)
**Type:** User Falsification Interface

Every reading includes the option for the user to say "No." Results are categorized:
- **WB** (Within Boundary)
- **ABE** (At Boundary Edge)
- **OSR** (Outside Symbolic Range)

**Verdict:** An OSR is not a failure we hide; it is data we log. By building a dashboard that asks "Did this miss?", every "Yes" earns its place.

### 8. The Architectural No: The Math Brain Separation
**Type:** Structural Independence

The system enforces a hard separation between the **Math Brain** (geometric calculation) and the **Poetic Brain** (narrative interpretation). The Math Brain is implemented as an independent computational layer that:
- Calculates planetary positions, aspects, and house placements using ephemeris data
- Outputs raw numerical values (Magnitude, SFD, Volatility) without interpretation
- Cannot be influenced by the narrative layer's "wishes"

**Implementation:** The Math Brain exists as a separate Repomix bundle (`raven-core`, `shipyard-engine`) that can be audited independently of the voice/interpretation layer.

**Verdict:** If the Poetic Brain wants a "good" reading but the Math Brain outputs Magnitude 4.8 / Bias -4.5, the numbers win. The architecture prevents the narrative from overriding the measurement.

## The Honesty Currency Principle

> *"The value of a 'Yes' is directly proportional to the system's demonstrated capacity to say 'No.'"*

A system that cannot fail cannot succeed. A gauge that never reads zero is not measuring anything.
