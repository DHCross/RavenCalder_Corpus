# **HOUSES IN THE WOVEN MAP SYSTEM**

**Technical Reference v1.2 | Role: The Analyst's Source**

**Purpose:** This document provides the structural engineering definitions for the 12 Chambers. It links the "Mirror Flow" engineering metaphors back to the Ancestral (Hellenistic) architecture, defining both the Capacity (Natal) and the Load (Symbolic Weather).

## **SECTION I: THE LOGIC OF THE SPLIT (NATAL VS. SYMBOLIC WEATHER)**

*The Woven Map strictly separates the Instrument (Blueprint) from the Force (Symbolic Weather).*

**1\. The Natal View (The Blueprint)**

* **Function:** Describes **Capacity**.  
* **Question:** "How is this room built?"  
* **Definition:** The fixed architectural function of the chamber.

**2\. The Symbolic Weather View (The Load)**

* **Function:** Describes **Stress**.  
* **Question:** "What pressure is hitting this room right now?"  
* **Definition:** The temporary atmospheric load (compression, expansion, maintenance) applied to the structure.

## **SECTION II: THE CHAMBER AUDIT (MASTER TABLE)**

*The translation of the 12 Chambers, linking Engineering Physics to Ancestral Architecture.*

| House | Woven Map (Engineering Label) | ANCESTRAL NAME (Hellenistic / Ancient) | NATAL FUNCTION (Blueprint / Capacity) | SYMBOLIC WEATHER FUNCTION (Load / Pressure) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1st** | **THE GATE** | **The Helm** (*Horoskopos*) | **The Interface.** "Where the chart steers itself." The filter that decides structural integrity and defense. | **Vitality Check.** Pressure on the hull. Tests the integrity of the vessel against external impact. |
| **2nd** | **THE STORE** | **Gate of Hades** (*Hades*) | **Fuel Tank.** Not just wealth, but "dependence and fragility." What sustains the life but can be taken away. | **Resource Load.** Pressure on capacity. Answers: "Do we have the fuel to sustain operations?" |
| **3rd** | **THE PATH** | **The Goddess** (*Dea*) | **Local Router.** The realm of "daily ritual and sacred repetition." Processing immediate data and short-range traffic. | **Signal Jam.** High volume of local inputs. Pressure on the nervous system or daily logistics. |
| **4th** | **THE ROOT** | **The Subterraneous** (*Hypogeion*) | **The Anchor.** The place where things "sink or settle." The foundation where the system cools down. | **Displacement.** Pressure on the foundation or lineage. Can indicate renovation or deep psychological shifting. |
| **5th** | **THE FORGE** | **Good Fortune** (*Agathe Tyche*) | **The Generator.** "Joyful outpouring." The zone of surplus energy converted into creation, risk, or offspring. | **Output Load.** High demand for creative expenditure. Manifests as a surge of generative power. |
| **6th** | **THE FIELD** | **Bad Fortune** (*Kake Tyche*) | **Maintenance.** The place of "strain and obligation." The engine room where labor drains the system. | **System Grind.** Pressure on the body’s systems. Manifests as duty, repair work, or health load. |
| **7th** | **THE MIRROR** | **The Setting Place** (*Dysis*) | **The Coupling.** Where the self "disappears into reflection." The port for locking into a secondary engine. | **Misalignment.** Pressure coming from "the other." Tests the integrity of the bond or contract. |
| **8th** | **THE CORE** | **The Idle Place** (*Epikatōphlion*) | **Fusion Chamber.** The "difficult zone" of debt, inheritance, and limits. Where separate codes merge or die. | **Compression.** Deep psychological pressure. Entanglements that force a state change or purge. |
| **9th** | **THE HORIZON** | **The God** (*Theos*) | **Navigation.** The "wide open sky of meaning." The Core Processor for long-distance bearings and philosophy. | **Perspective Shift.** Pressure on worldviews. Correlates with travel, legal issues, or publishing. |
| **10th** | **THE CANOPY** | **Midheaven** (*Mesouranima*) | **The Roof / Display.** The "visible summit." The structure seen by the public (career/authority). | **Visibility Load.** Pressure to perform or lead. The structure is tested by public scrutiny. |
| **11th** | **THE GROVE** | **Good Spirit** (*Agathos Daimon*) | **The Grid.** "Fortune's Ally." Support from the wider network, friends, and the collective weave. | **Static.** Pressure from networks. Tension regarding alliances, social circuitry, or future hopes. |
| **12th** | **THE SHELL** | **Bad Spirit** (*Kakos Daimon*) | **Recovery / Sleep.** The "place of undoing." Where the system goes offline or dissolves into the background. | **Ghost Load.** Pressure from the unconscious. Manifests as fatigue, isolation, or the return of old patterns. |

## **SECTION III: THE CRITIQUE OF LITERALISM (WHY WE RENAME)**

*Modern astrological names often describe "activities" (what happens there). The Woven Map and Ancestral names describe "architecture" (what the room is). This distinction is critical for diagnostic accuracy.*

| House | Modern Literal Name (Avoid) | The Woven Map Structural Critique |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1st** | Self, Identity | Obscures **The Helm**—the mechanism where the chart steers itself and maintains hull integrity. |
| **2nd** | Money, Possessions | Misses **The Gate of Hades**—the architectural vulnerability of sustenance and the fuel required to survive. |
| **3rd** | Communication | Reduces **The Goddess** to emails. Misses the structural function of **Daily Ritual** and local routing. |
| **4th** | Home, Family | Simplifies **The Subterraneous**—the deep anchor point where things sink, settle, and cool down. |
| **5th** | Creativity, Fun | Narrows **Good Fortune** (Cosmic Delight) to a hobby. This is the **Generator** of surplus energy and risk. |
| **6th** | Health, Work | Sanitizes **Bad Fortune**. This is the **Engine Room** of structural strain, obligation, and maintenance. |
| **7th** | Marriage | Limits **The Setting Place**—the optical physics where the Self disappears into reflection. |
| **8th** | Shared Resources | Psychologizes **The Idle Place**—the difficult, high-pressure zone of debt, limits, and inevitability. |
| **9th** | Philosophy, Travel | Secularizes **The God**—the wide open sky of Meaning and Long-Range Navigation. |
| **10th** | Career | Reduces **The Midheaven**—the visible summit of the structure—to a job title. |
| **11th** | Friends | Simplifies **The Good Spirit**—the structural support beam provided by the wider network/weave. |
| **12th** | Unconscious | Psychologizes **The Bad Spirit**—the architectural space of undoing, dissolution, and system sleep. |

## **SECTION IV: THE ENGINEERING DIAGNOSTIC (READING SYMBOLIC WEATHER)**

*In The Woven Map, you do not predict events. You diagnose Structural Load.*

**1\. The Protocol**

* **Identify the Engine (Transit Planet):** What kind of force is applying pressure? (e.g., Saturn \= Compression; Mars \= Friction).  
* **Identify the Chamber (House):** Where is this pressure landing? (e.g., The Canopy).

**2\. The Synthesis**

* *Standard Approach:* "Saturn in the 10th House means trouble at work."  
* *Woven Map Diagnostic:* "There is currently a **High Compression Load (Saturn)** on your **Public Structure (Canopy)**. The system is being tested for structural integrity. Do not accelerate against this compression."

**3\. Critical Note on Location**

* **The Rule:** The "Event Horizon" (Symbolic Weather) changes based on where you stand.  
* **Implication:** A storm hitting your **Store** in New York might rotate to hit your **Gate** in London. Accurate location data is required to know *where* the pressure lands.
