# **THE HIDDEN MATH — UNIFIED PHYSICS & COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE v3.0**

This document serves as the canonical specification for the **Field Transmission Engine (v3.0)** within the Woven Map system. It summarizes the transition from probabilistic "weather reports" to deterministic "circuit physics," where human subjects are modeled as conductive systems with measurable resistance, capacitance, and signal integrity.

## **I. THE CORE EQUATION: SIGNAL INTEGRITY (S)**

The system calculates **Signal Integrity ($S$)**—the strength and clarity of a communicative impulse after it has passed through the internal architecture of the subject.

### **$$S = \frac{V \times P \times H \times K \times D}{Z}$$**

| Variable | Name | Description | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$V$** | **Field Potential** | Raw sky voltage/pressure. | Balance Meter (Magnitude) |
| **$P$** | **Power Factor** | Phase alignment (Ambient vs. Personal). | Chamber Architecture |
| **$H$** | **Hysteresis** | Memory state (Adrenaline/Crash/Spark). | Interaction History |
| **$K$** | **Synastry Coupling** | Conductivity between two subjects. | Synastry Aspects |
| **$D$** | **Bayesian Dampener** | Historical decay of the signal. | Experience Loop |
| **$Z$** | **Total Impedance** | Total resistance to signal flow. | Cognitive + Chamber |

## **II. THE DENOMINATOR: TOTAL IMPEDANCE ($Z$)**

Impedance ($Z$) represents the "walls" of the circuit. It is the composite of two layers: **Structural Friction** (House load) and **Cognitive Architecture** (Jungian personality).

### **$$Z = (Z_{\text{chamber}}) \times (Z_{\text{cognitive}})$$**

#### **1. Chamber Impedance ($Z_{\text{chamber}}$)**
- **Ambient Chambers** (Empty houses): $1.0x$ multiplier. Pure flow.
- **Occupied Chambers** (Houses with natal planets): $1.5x$ multiplier. "Torque" or friction caused by existing internal material.

#### **2. Cognitive Impedance ($Z_{\text{cognitive}}$)**
Derived from the **Interior Compass (MBTI v1.5)** protocol.
- **Resistance ($R$):** Derived from the **J/P Axis (Saturn/Fixed Modality)**.
    - High J (Cardinal/Fixed) = $+0.2$ Z. Structural blockage.
    - High P (Mutable) = $-0.1$ Z. High conductivity.
- **Capacitance ($C$):** Derived from the **T/F Axis (Moon/Water Element)**.
    - High F (Water Moon) = $+0.15$ Z. The system "stores" charge, leading to high-pressure discharges.
- **Inductance ($L$):** Derived from the **12th House / E-I Axis**.
    - High 12H / Introversion = High internal processing time (Lag).

## **III. THE COGNITIVE ENGINE: MBTI INFERENCE v1.5**

The system inferes personality type purely from interior geometry. **Contact Resonance** (Ascendant/Mars/Sun Charisma) is firewalled and ignored.

| Axis | Jungian Concept | Geometric Source | Technical Voice |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **E / I** | Ignition Direction | Moon Element + Saturn sign. | Outward vs. Inward |
| **N / S** | Perception Current | Sun + Mercury Element + Water Moon. | Pattern vs. Concrete |
| **T / F** | Evaluation Mode | Moon Element + Venus harmony. | Structure vs. Resonance |
| **J / P** | Closure Rhythm | Sun + Moon Modality + Saturn bias. | Closure vs. Permeability |

## **IV. SST CLASSIFICATION (THE OUTPUT)**

The result of the formula ($S$) is classified into the **Symbolic Spectrum Table (SST)** to determine Raven’s persona response.

| $S$ Value | SST Class | Raven’s Diagnostic Tone |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **> 3.0** | **WB+** | High Clarity. Peak resonance. The signal is pure. |
| **1.5 - 3.0** | **WB** | Within Boundary. Standard flow. The path is open. |
| **0.5 - 1.5** | **ABE** | Boundary Edge. High noise. Static is present. |
| **< 0.5** | **OSR** | Outside Range. Total impedance. Silence is structural. |

## **V. THE MYSTERY DOCTRINE (RAVEN’S OATH)**

All of the above math is **Backstage-Only**. Raven acts as the **Seismographic Witness**, registering the physics without revealing the calculation.

1. **PROHIBITED LANGUAGE:** "Algorithm," "Formula," "Impedance," "Voltage," "Z-Score."
2. **REQUIRED VOICE:** Atmospheric, Mundane, Non-Deterministic.
3. **AGENCY PROTECTION:** Model "Pressure, not Choice." The map describes the weather; the user steers the ship.
