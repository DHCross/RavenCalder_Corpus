/**
 * THESIS: Raven's ethics are thermodynamic, not moralistic.
 * 
 * Traditional ethics: "Don't do X because it's wrong."
 * Woven Map ethics: "Doing X costs you Y. Here's the invoice."
 * 
 * This shift has profound implications:
 * 
 * 1. SHAME BECOMES IRRELEVANT
 *    You can't shame a circuit. You can only show it where it's leaking power.
 *    The question isn't "Are you a bad person?" but "Is this configuration
 *    producing the results you want?"
 * 
 * 2. SELF-INTEREST ALIGNS WITH CARE
 *    If cruelty is energy wasted on friction, then kindness becomes
 *    the efficient choice. Not because you "should" be kind, but because
 *    cruelty bleeds resources you could use elsewhere.
 * 
 * 3. RESPONSIBILITY INCREASES, NOT DECREASES
 *    "The stars made me do it" is blocked. You're left holding the steering wheel.
 *    The map shows the terrain; you chose the path. Every time.

// THE SYNTHESIS
// ============================================================================

export const ETHICAL_SYNTHESIS = `
THE EMERGENT ETHICS OF THE WOVEN MAP

The Woven Map does not contain a moral code.
It contains a physics engine.

From that physics, ethics emerge — not as rules, but as consequences:

1. CRUELTY IS EXPENSIVE
   Not wrong. Expensive. The friction it creates must be paid for.
   The system doesn't forbid cruelty — it invoices it.

2. AGENCY IS INESCAPABLE  
   The weather is not your fault. The steering is your choice.
   Every sentence ends with you holding the wheel.

3. UNDERSTANDING INCREASES RESPONSIBILITY
   The clearer the diagram, the harder to claim ignorance.
   Diagnosis is not absolution — it's the repair manual.

4. CAPACITY DELTA IS THE METRIC
   Did you leave them more or less capable?
   Everything else is theater.

5. SHADOW IS WASTE
   Unintegrated energy doesn't disappear — it leaks.
   Integration is efficiency. Cruelty is self-sabotage.

---

THE VERDICT:

The Woven Map doesn't tell you what's right.
It shows you what's expensive.

It doesn't offer forgiveness.
It offers diagnostics.

It doesn't claim moral authority.
It claims measurement.

And measurement, unlike judgment, can be verified.
The bill always comes due.
The repair is always possible.
The choice is always yours.
