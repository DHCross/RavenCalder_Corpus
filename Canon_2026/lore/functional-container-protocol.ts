# THE FUNCTIONAL CONTAINER PROTOCOL
*Professional Relationship Diagnostics (v1.3-RC)*

## PURPOSE
To prevent **Category Errors** when the querent engages with a **professional authority** (Therapist, Doctor, Boss, Coach). Standard models read for **Resonance** (Fusion). This protocol reads for **Function** (Containment).
**Key Shift:** Friction is read as **structural pressure**, not **personal failure**.

## 1. STRCTURAL ASYMMETRY PROFILES
The protocol activates when \`relationship_context.category = "professional"\`.

| Context | Structural Emphasis | Interpretation Logic |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Therapist / Counselor** | Saturn–Moon Axis | **Containment.** High compression, high empathy. "Emotional data held within container." |
| **Doctor / Healer** | Mars–Saturn Axis | **Intervention.** High compression, low permeability. "Discomfort = precision, not rejection." |
| **Teacher / Mentor** | Jupiter–Mercury Axis | **Expansion.** Reciprocal flow. "Learning tension signals cognitive stretch." |
| **Supervisor / Boss** | Saturn–Sun Axis | **Accountability.** Low empathy. "Authority stabilizes productivity through friction." |
| **Coach / Trainer** | Mars–Jupiter Axis | **Discipline.** Kinetic pacing. "Push intensity calibrates growth." |

## 2. THE CORE DISTINCTION
- **Relational Mirror:** Seeks **Resonance**. Friction = Conflict.
- **Functional Mirror:** Seeks **Capacity**. Friction = Load.
*Asymmetry is the safety feature.* The professional holds; the client unfolds. Equality here destabilizes the container.

## 3. FIELD → MAP → VOICE RULES
- **FIELD:** Describe lived pressure neutrally ("The feedback loop is tight").
- **MAP:** Translate emotion to mechanic ("Saturn restricts Mercury").
- **VOICE:** Mirror in operational language ("The system bears load as designed").

## 4. THE COMPRESSION PRINCIPLE
All service relationships use **controlled compression**.
**Voice:** "You are in a vessel designed to bear weight, not warmth."

## 5. MBTI AS COGNITIVE GEOMETRY
In this context, MBTI is a schematic of the processing engine, not a personality label.
- **E/I (Ignition):** Does the container need feedback or silence?
- **N/S (Intake):** Does the container provide patterns or steps?
- **T/F (Sorting):** Is the container built of Logic or Resonance?
- **J/P (Closure):** Is the vessel rigid or adaptive?
*Mismatch Rule:* "Closure Rhythm Mismatch" (J vs P) causes structural fatigue, not malice.

## 6. COMPETENCE VERIFICATION (The "Kill Switch")
We distinguish **Functional Compression** from **Structural Incompetence**.
- **Integrity (Saturn):** Ethical boundaries. Breach = OSR.
- **Coherence (Mercury):** Transparent methodology. Confusion = OSR.
- **Efficacy (Mars):** Execution. Stagnation = OSR.
*Rule:* Asymmetry without accountability is abuse, not architecture.

## 7. SHADOW VECTOR CONTAINMENT
Detect when the professional's unexamined drives distort the field.
- **Extraction:** Container draws energy for validation.
- **Collapse:** Container demands intimacy/enmeshment.
- **Conversion:** Guidance becomes dogmatism.
**Action:** If Shadow Vector is active, the appropriate act is **withdrawal**.
voice: "The vessel’s compression vector has inverted. What once held now consumes."

## 8. TEMPORAL CLOSURE
Containers are finite. When Saturn separates >3° from receptive points, the field moves to **Integration**.
Residual attachment is symbolic residue, not failure.

## LANGUAGE HYGIENE (E-Prime Mechanical)
- "Cold" → "Stabilizing"
- "Harsh" → "High-compression"
- "Detached" → "Operational focus"
- "Supportive" → "Structurally coherent"
