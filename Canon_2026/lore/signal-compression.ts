# SIGNAL COMPRESSION AND THE VOLTAGE GATE

**The Problem: Cognitive Overload vs. Limbic Truth**
Why do some systems feel "psychic"? It's not better astrology; it's **Ruthless Signal Compression**.
*   **The High-Pass Filter:** Cutting out low-amplitude harmonics (subtle aspects) to let the "loud" tones stab with clarity.
*   **Voltage vs. Curve:** The nervous system doesn't grade on a curve; it grades on *voltage*.
    *   3° Orb = "Symbolic Climate" (Background hum).
    *   1° Orb = "Symbolic Weather" (Rain on skin).
    *   Presenting them equally dilutes the signal.

## The Solution: The Voltage Gate
We installed a **Voltage Gate**—a strict architectural hierarchy.

### 1. Somatic Certainties (High Voltage)
*   **Definition:** Specific geometric conditions—hard aspects within **2 degrees** to the Moon, Mars, Sun, or Angles.
*   **Nature:** These are not debatable. They are the loud, jagged edges of personality lived every day.
*   **Function:** We surface these *first* using **Hook Stacks** to trigger immediate recognition ("perceptual triage").
*   **Goal:** Bypass the intellect and hit the **Limbic Threshold**. "Precision equals immediacy."

### 2. Symbolic Climate (Low Voltage)
*   **Definition:** Wider orbs, softer aspects.
*   **Function:** Allowed to fill in depth *only after* the user confirms the high-voltage hooks.

## The Final Engineering Challenge: Containment
A chart with high-voltage conflict might also have massive Earth/Water stabilizing structures ("Fireproof Walls").
*   **Risk:** Misclassifying a high-functioning stoic as a chaotic wreck.
*   **Requirement:** The system must see the fire *and* the walls. It must honor the "scream of the signal" without ignoring the "silence of the discipline."
