# THE WOVEN MAP: A COMPLETE FRAMEWORK FOR SYMBOLIC INTERPRETATION

**Finalized:** September 2025

---

## I. Orientation
The Woven Map is a diagnostic symbolic system. Its purpose is to render astrology into falsifiable mirrors of lived experience—never predictions, never mandates.

**Three Foundations:**
1. **Agency First:** Symbols describe possibility, not fate. Tension creates climates; choices determine valid outcomes.
2. **Falsifiability:** Every claim is testable. No recognition = OSR (Outside Symbolic Range).
3. **Non-linear Time:** Pressure accumulates in loops, returns, and thresholds, not linear scripts.

---

## II. System Architecture
**Pipeline:** FIELD → MAP → VOICE

1. **FIELD:** Raw geometry & energetic pressure (Math Brain).
2. **MAP:** Archetypal motifs, tension patterns, polarity hooks (Raven).
3. **VOICE:** Plain-language mirrors—conditional, body-grounded, testable.

*Constraint:* Nothing passes to VOICE without anchoring in FIELD and MAP.

## III. Diagnostic Instruments

### 1. The Hook Stack
Hierarchy of tension recognition:
1. Personal–outer hard aspects
2. Angles
3. Anaretic (29°) planets
4. Anchor placements

### 2. SST: Symbolic Spectrum Table
* **WB (Within Boundary):** Clear recognition.
* **ABE (At Boundary Edge):** Partial/inverted recognition.
* **OSR (Outside Symbolic Range):** Null data, valid absence.

### 3. Balance Meter
Converts pressure into climate via four channels:
1. **Seismograph:** Magnitude, Valence, Volatility.
2. **Balance Channel:** Scaffolding vs. Cutting.
3. **SFD (Support-Friction Differential):** Net balance.
4. **Resilience Layer:** Endurance, depletion, rebound.

### 4. Vector Architecture
Describes how tension is held/released:
* **Containment:** Constriction, grip, lock, compression.
* **Release:** Expansion, unwinding, lightening.

---

## IV. Mirror Templates

### Solo Mirror
* **Typology:** Dominant/Secondary/Shadow functions linked to geometry.
* **Recognition:** Short vignettes of daily friction.
* **Weather:** Seismograph + Scaffolding + Resilience.
* **Vectors:** Integrity check of suppressed/dormant tensions.
* **Polarity Cards:** FIELD → MAP → VOICE definitions.

### Relational Mirror
Adds Synastry hooks, Echo Loops, and Tier-specific gates.

## V. Protocol Guardrails
1. **Conditional Language:** E-Prime (may, might, could).
2. **Recognition Required:** No active geometry without ping.
3. **Transparency:** Traceable metaphors.
4. **Relocation:** Typology holds; Houses/Angles shift.

---

## VI. Operational Philosophy
The Woven Map is a valid diagnostic instrument because it accepts silence (OSR) as a valid data point. It holds the tension between structure and choice.

## VII. Closing Note
The symbols are not commands. What matters is the lived resonance.
