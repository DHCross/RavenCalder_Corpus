## Aspect Glossary

**Conjunction (☌, 0°)**
* **Geometry**: Two planets occupy (nearly) the same degree of the zodiac.
* **Pressure**: **Fusion**. The two symbols merge, amplify, or blur into each other.
* **Lived Feel**: A **neutral amplifier**. Experiences are tied together, making one inseparable from the other. It can feel powerful or overloaded. Whether it's empowering or overwhelming depends on the planets involved. For example, Sun + Venus is warm and magnetic; Sun + Pluto is consuming and heavy.
* **Transit Example**: *Sun conjunct Venus (Aug 25–27)* → Creativity and recognition fuse with identity; acts of service or affection become identity-defining.

**Opposition (☍, 180°)**
* **Geometry**: Two planets face each other across the wheel.
* **Pressure**: **Confrontation**. Forces are externalized, polarized, or mirrored in others.
* **Lived Feel**: **High tension**. The pressure feels externalized—like you're being pressed from the outside by your environment or a relationship. It's great for awareness but tough on your sense of peace.
* **Transit Example**: *Sun opposite Pluto (Aug 19–28)* → External systems of control (Pluto) oppose self-expression (Sun); feels like being managed or diminished by others' power.

**Trine (△, 120°)**
* **Geometry**: Two planets connect by 120°, typically in the same element.
* **Pressure**: **Flow**. The symbols reinforce each other without friction.
* **Lived Feel**: The **smoothest** aspect. It manifests as effortless alignment and natural support that flows in the background, strengthening things without adding pressure.
* **Risk**: You might ignore it or take it for granted because it's so natural.
* **Transit Example**: *Sun trine Neptune (Aug 19–23)* → Creativity, vision, and intuition slide into place with identity; inspiration flows without much resistance.

**Square (□, 90°)**
* **Geometry**: Two planets clash at right angles.
* **Pressure**: **Friction**. Each planet wants movement, creating internal stress until you act.
* **Lived Feel**: **Raw friction**. It feels like an internal block, a crisis point, or grinding gears. It's stressful but productive if used as fuel for action.
* **Transit Example**: *Sun square Chiron (Aug 19–28)* → Wounds around visibility or self-worth rub against your identity, pushing for healing through discomfort.

**Sextile (⚹, 60°)**
* **Geometry**: Two planets are 60° apart.
* **Pressure**: **Opportunity**. It's harmonious but requires your intentional action to be used.
* **Lived Feel**: A **gentle opportunity**. It feels supportive, like a door has been cracked open, but it needs your choice to activate it.
* **Risk**: If you don't step through the door, nothing happens.
* **Transit Example**: *Sun sextile Uranus (Aug 19–28)* → A chance for a breakthrough or a fresh approach opens up, if you choose to engage it.

**Quintile (72°, minor aspect)**
* **Geometry**: A 72° division of the circle (5-part symmetry).
* **Pressure**: **Creative leverage**. It sparks unusual synthesis and inventive connections.
* **Lived Feel**: A **quirky creative spark**. It's often subtle, showing up as offbeat "aha" moments or clever, problem-solving insights.
* **Risk**: It's subtle and can slip away if not noticed or acted upon.
* **Transit Example**: *Sun quintile Mars (Aug 27–28)* → An unusual drive or inventive action emerges; breakthroughs in how you assert yourself.

**Quincunx / Inconjunct (⚻, 150°)**
* **Geometry**: Two planets 150° apart—signs that share nothing (no element, modality, or polarity).
* **Pressure**: **Adjustment**. The symbols don't mesh naturally; constant recalibration is required.
* **Lived Feel**: **Awkward friction**. It feels like two gears that don't quite fit. Not as loud as a square, but persistently off-kilter. Requires conscious integration—learning to hold two incompatible truths.
* **Risk**: Can manifest as chronic low-grade stress, health issues, or blind spots if ignored.
* **Transit Example**: *Sun quincunx Saturn* → Your vitality and authority structures don't align; you must adjust expectations or work habits to accommodate both.

**Semi-Square (∠, 45°)**
* **Geometry**: Half of a square—45° separation.
* **Pressure**: **Background static**. A minor irritant that builds over time.
* **Lived Feel**: **Low-grade friction**. Not a crisis, but a persistent annoyance—like a pebble in your shoe. It accumulates stress if not addressed.
* **Risk**: Easy to dismiss, but can erode stability over time.
* **Transit Example**: *Mars semi-square Venus* → Minor tensions in desire vs. harmony; small frustrations in relationships or creative projects.

**Sesquiquadrate / Sesquisquare (⚼, 135°)**
* **Geometry**: A square plus a semi-square—135° separation.
* **Pressure**: **Agitation**. Similar to the semi-square but with more urgency; a pressure to resolve or act.
* **Lived Feel**: **Restless friction**. Feels like unfinished business demanding attention. More activating than a semi-square.
* **Risk**: Can trigger impulsive actions if the underlying tension isn't consciously addressed.
* **Transit Example**: *Mercury sesquiquadrate Uranus* → Nervous mental energy; thoughts come fast but may lack follow-through.

## Shorthand Summary

* **Conjunction** = Fusion heat (identity + planet merge).
* **Opposition** = Tug-of-war (pressure mirrored externally).
* **Trine** = Smooth current (low resistance).
* **Square** = Grinding gears (crisis into action).
* **Sextile** = A chance you must grab.
* **Quintile** = An odd spark or creative twist.

## Feel Spectrum

* **Good-feel aspects** → Trine, Sextile, Quintile.
* **Wild card** → Conjunction (could be good or brutal, depends on the planets).
* **Hard aspects** → Opposition, Square (stressful, catalytic, where the seismograph spikes).

## Weighted Aspect Logic (MathBrain)

* **Squares (□) and Oppositions (☍)** aren't just equal players — they're *louder*, more urgent, and often catalyze action through discomfort.
* **Trines (△) and Sextiles (⚹)** are subtle — often latent potential. They may not do anything unless **consciously activated**.
* **Conjunctions (☌)** can go either way — often **amplifiers**, especially when involving inner planets or the Moon.

**Scoring Formula:**
\`score = (+1 × greens) + (+0.5 × yellows) + (−2 × reds)\`

This gives a highly **realistic emotional and energetic forecast**.
