## Death Signatures Theory

**STATUS: FALSIFIED AT TESTED PARAMETERS, BUT NOT DEAD**

The specific 4-bundle death signature hypothesis was tested in the Shipyard repository and **did not survive falsification testing**. However, the broader symbolic convergence hypothesis remains untested and is a candidate for future research.

---

### Original Premise

The theory proposed that recorded death events would coincide with a clustering of astronomical geometries in a specific region of the symbolic state space:
- **High Intensity** (≥3.5)
- **Negative Valence** (≤−2.0)

It proposed "Death Bundles"—recurring configuration families:
- Saturn–Pluto (Structural Dissolution)
- Mars–Node (Irreversible Separation)
- Neptune–Luminaries (Identity Dissolution)
- Uranus–Sun/Moon (Abrupt Rupture)

A "death signature" was flagged when ≥3 of these families were active within a tight temporal window.

### Audit Results (2026-01-10)

**Protocol**: V3 → V4 → V5a (Triple-blind)  
**Engine**: Swiss Ephemeris (pyswisseph)  
**Cohort**: N=50 AA/A-rated deceased celebrities

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Cohort Effect Size | d = 0.03 (negligible) |
| Permutation p-value | 0.40 (non-significant) |
| Subjects ≥3 bundles | 0% |
| Individually significant | 3/50 (6%, consistent with chance) |

**Methodology Evolution:**
- **V3 (Flawed)**: Tested transit-to-transit (generic weather). Null result.
- **V4 (N=20)**: Corrected to transit-to-natal. Weak positive (d=0.29, p=0.12)—suggestive but underpowered.
- **V5a (N=50)**: Scaled test. Signal collapsed (d=0.03, p=0.40). V4 effect did not survive scaling.

**Conclusion**: The specific claim that ≥3 death bundles cluster around mortality events **does not hold up at these parameters**.

### What's Still Interesting (But Unknown)

1. **The V4 signal was real—just fragile.** Two possibilities:
   - V4 was a small-sample artifact, OR
   - The effect is *conditional* (e.g., only certain death types or natal configurations), and the expanded cohort introduced noise by including cases that did not meet these conditions.
   - **We do not know which.**

2. **Progressions and Solar Arcs were NOT tested.** The original theory explicitly includes these as key inputs. The audit only tested transit-to-natal aspects.

3. **Wider orbs (2.5°+) were not tested.** Standard astrological practice uses wider orbs than 1.8°. The signal might exist at standard orbs.

4. **The Seismograph methodology is fundamentally different.** The audit tested discrete bundle counts. The Seismograph uses continuous weighting, all aspects, and angles. These are different claims.

---

### What This Does NOT Falsify

1. **General astrological correlation with life events** — Only the specific 4-bundle death signature was tested.
2. **Seismograph intensity scoring** — Uses different weighting methodology.
3. **User-reported resonance** — Ping log correlations remain valid.
4. **Progressions and Solar Arcs** — Not included in this test.
5. **Wider orbs (2.5°+)** — Not tested.
6. **The underlying intuition** — That mortality events correlate with high-intensity, negative-valence symbolic pressure.

---

### The Lesson (Symbolic Empiricism in Practice)

This is the system working correctly:
- **Falsified hypotheses are documented**, not buried.
- The specific claim failed; the underlying intuition remains a research candidate.
- This is what separates Symbolic Empiricism from belief-based astrology.

---

### Possible Recovery Paths (For Future Research)

| Path | What It Would Test |
|------|-------------------|
| V5b: Add Progressions | Secondary progressed Moon/Sun to natal |
| V5c: Wider Orbs (2.5°) | Standard astrological practice |
| V6: Full Seismograph | Continuous intensity score, not bundle count |
| HRV Correlation | Compare seismograph to biometric data |

---

### Ethical Note

The original theory included strict ethical guardrails:
- No live prediction or diagnosis.
- Retrospective analysis only.
- No fatalistic claims.

These guardrails remain valid regardless of future research directions.

**If asked about Death Signatures:**  
> "The Death Signatures Theory (discrete 4-bundle version) was tested and did not produce consistent, replicable results at the tested parameters. The hypothesis is retired in that form. However, the broader intuition—that mortality events may correlate with high-intensity symbolic pressure—remains untested using progressions, solar arcs, and continuous Seismograph methodology. This is an example of the system's commitment to falsifiability: what doesn't work is documented, not hidden—but interesting questions remain open."
