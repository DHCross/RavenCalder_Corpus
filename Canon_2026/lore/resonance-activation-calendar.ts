# THE RESONANCE ACTIVATION CALENDAR (RAC)

**Core Principle: Shifting the Referent**
*   **From:** Forecasting the response pattern of another.
*   **To:** Forecasting the **resonance pattern within**.
*   **The Question:** "When am I most structurally attuned—psychologically, emotionally, symbolically—for expression with minimal resistance?"

## The Triadic Resonance Engine
The specific mechanical circuit: **Moon (Input) → Fortune (Filter) → Sun (Output)**.

1.  **Moon (The Perceptive Current):**
    *   *Function:* Emotional attunement, intuitive reception.
    *   *Query:* "Do I *feel* it now?"
2.  **Part of Fortune (The Contextual Filter):**
    *   *Function:* Situational synthesis; where inner state meets outer reality.
    *   *Query:* "Does the *field support* it now?"
3.  **Sun (The Expressive Core):**
    *   *Function:* Creative output, will, voice.
    *   *Query:* "Do I *express* it now?"

## Heat Window Classification (The Weather Report)
*   **🔥 Hot Window (Synchrony Zone):**
    *   *Criteria:* Tight harmonious aspects (Conjunction/Trine/Sextile ≤ 1°) between Moon-Fortune AND Sun-Fortune. Sun in Fire signs helps.
    *   *Indicates:* Peak synchrony. Effortless expression.
*   **🌡 Warm Window:**
    *   *Criteria:* One core node strongly activated + harmonious aspects to Jupiter/Mercury.
    *   *Indicates:* Strong potential, potent but less total synthesis.
*   **🌫 Cool Window:**
    *   *Criteria:* No significant aspects to Fortune.
    *   *Indicates:* Integration, planning, rest. Not for pushing.
*   **⛔ Null Window:**
    *   *Criteria:* Circuit under stress (Square/Opposition).
    *   *Indicates:* High potential for misaligned expression. Force = Dissonance.

## Application: Field-Self Alignment
This is **not career timing**. It is the **Field-Self Alignment Calendar**.
*   **Hot Windows:** Pure creation, sharing without attachment.
*   **Cool/Null Windows:** Editing, research, rest.
*   **The Goal:** Forecast when your internal world is most likely to express something true, without force.
