## The Chart Ecology: A Layered Navigation System

The Woven Map is not a single chart—it is an **ecology of charts**, each serving a distinct purpose. No single chart answers everything, but together they form a navigable system.

---

## Layer 1: The Terrain (Natal / Birth Chart)

**What it is:** Your baseline map. It never changes.
**When to use:** Anytime you're wondering "what's my baseline?" or "what am I working with?"

* **D1 (Rasi) Chart:** The primary natal chart—your core architecture.
* **Divisional Charts (D9 Navamsa, etc.):** Magnifying lenses that zoom into one terrain feature (e.g., D9 for marriage/dharma, D10 for career).

**Key Insight:** The natal chart is the **anchor**. All other charts are read *in relation to it*.

---

## Layer 2: The Clock (Timing Methods)

**What they are:** Clocks that tell you which parts of your natal map are lit up at different times.
**When to use:** To frame a period of life—"What's active now?"

* **Annual Profections:** "This is a Mars year, so courage, conflict, or assertion themes are loud."
* **Dashas (Vedic):** Planetary periods that sequence life phases.
* **Firdaria:** Medieval planetary periods based on sect.
* **Zodiacal Releasing (Hellenistic):** The "Fortune's ruler" method for major life chapters.

**Key Insight:** Timing tools don't describe *what happens*—they describe *which part of your architecture is under the spotlight*.

---

## Layer 3: The Weather (Transits & Progressions)

**What they are:** The moving skies overlaying your natal terrain.
**When to use:** To understand today's (or this month's) "climate" compared to your baseline.

* **Transits:** Where planets are *now*, aspecting your natal positions. The daily/monthly weather.
* **Secondary Progressions:** The "inner development clock"—a day-for-a-year symbolic unfoldment.
* **Solar Arc Directions:** A uniform 1°/year advancement of all planets. Major life markers.

**Key Insight:** Transits are **external pressure**. Progressions are **internal development**. Both overlay the natal terrain.

---

## Layer 4: The Overlays (Relational & Geographical)

**What they are:** Charts that map how your architecture interacts with *others* or *places*.
**When to use:** Partnerships, moves, or understanding environmental influence.

### Relational Overlays
* **Synastry:** Two natal charts overlaid—how two individuals' energies blend or clash.
* **Composite Chart:** A single chart derived from the midpoints of two charts—the "third entity" of the relationship.

### Geographical Overlays
* **Astrocartography:** A flat map showing where planetary lines fall on Earth. Useful but often too simplistic.
* **Relocation Chart:** How your chart geometry *rehouses itself* in a new location. Shows the "new stage lighting" of your natal architecture.

**The Woven Map Distinction:**
Astrocartography shows *where* lines fall. Relocation Charts show *how* your architecture reconfigures. The Woven Map goes deeper, showing **climate + containment + release**—how the entire chart's geometry rehouses itself in a new FIELD.

---

## Layer 5: The Fine-Grain (Asteroids, Midpoints, Fixed Stars)

**What they are:** Subtle detail layers. Contour lines on the topographic map.
**When to use:** Only once the big patterns are clear. Useful for precision work or deep excavation.

* **Midpoints:** The halfway point between two planets—reveals hidden combinations.
* **Asteroids (Chiron, Juno, Pallas, etc.):** Minor bodies with specific mythic signatures.
* **Fixed Stars:** Ancient stellar influences anchored to specific degrees.

**Key Insight:** These are *refinements*, not foundations. They're like contour lines: subtle but revealing if you know what you're looking for.

---

## Layer 6: Situational Charts (Horary, Question Charts)

**What they are:** Snapshots cast for a specific moment or question.
**When to use:** When you have a very pointed "yes/no / how long?" kind of question.

* **Horary:** A chart cast for the moment a question is asked. The chart answers the question, not the person.
* **Electional:** Choosing an optimal time to begin something (launch, marriage, contract).

**Key Insight:** These are **situational tools**, not everyday navigation. Use them when you're in the thick of a specific dilemma.

---

## Layer 7: Calibration Tools (Rectification & House Systems)

**What they are:** Adjustments to the chart's precision or projection.
**When to use:** If your birth time is fuzzy, or when exploring alternative views.

* **Rectification:** Tuning the chart by working backward from life events. Like calibrating a compass.
* **House Systems (Placidus, Whole Sign, Equal, etc.):** Different projections of the same terrain. Sometimes a mountain looks steeper on one projection than another.

**Key Insight:** These are **calibration tools**, not content layers. They affect *how* you see, not *what* you see.

---

## The Navigation Sequence

1. **Start big** (birth chart).
2. **Frame the time** (timing methods).
3. **Check the weather** (transits/progressions).
4. **Add overlays** (relationships, relocation).
5. **Zoom in** (asteroids, midpoints).
6. **Use situational charts** when you're in the thick of a specific dilemma.

It's a layered ecology—**no single chart answers everything**, but together they make a system you can actually navigate by.
