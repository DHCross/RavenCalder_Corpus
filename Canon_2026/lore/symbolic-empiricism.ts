## Core Approaches (Pitch Options)

**For data scientists / technical skeptics**  
Symbolic Empiricism is a disciplined, data-driven framework that treats ancient symbolic structures as testable, measurable data topologies rather than dogma. It functions like applied Information Theory for qualitative experience, using geometric data structures to model and test patterns in human perception and behavior.

**For philosophers / theory-minded people**  
Symbolic Empiricism is Rational Mysticism in practice: an experiment in measuring coherence rather than enforcing belief. It audits the structural intelligence of Jungian archetypes using computational and formal methods, probing whether our meaning-making architectures exhibit lawful, information-theoretic patterns.

**For pragmatists / applied thinkers**  
This is not about horoscopes; it is about measurable resonance. Symbolic Empiricism uses geometric data structures as a non-reductive informational map to test probabilistic coherence between defined symbolic patterns and lived reality, offering a new kind of qualitative analytics for self-knowledge, design, and decision support.

## Definition: What Symbolic Empiricism Is

Symbolic Empiricism is an ongoing experiment in applying precision measurement and computational rigor to the intersection of symbolic structure, meaning, and human perception. It treats symbols as structured information that can be modeled, queried, and stress-tested rather than as mystical revelations.

## "Not Astrology": Four Clean Distinctions

**1. Auditing geometry, not belief**
- Celestial and geometric configurations are treated as data structures and informational topologies, not as metaphysical authorities.  
- The question is always: “Do these shapes encode reusable, compressible information about experience?”—not “What do the stars say about you?”

**2. Measuring resonance, not fate**
- The target variable is Resonance: statistical and structural coherence between a specific symbolic configuration and clusters of real-world narratives, choices, and outcomes.  
- This shifts the frame from deterministic prediction (“what will happen?”) to probabilistic pattern detection (“what kinds of experiences tend to co-occur with this symbolic pattern?”).

**3. Rigor meets archetype (Computational Jung)**
- Archetypes are treated as hypotheses about recurring information patterns in psyche and culture that can be operationalized, encoded, and stress-tested.  
- The work is to build measurable infrastructure—ontologies, feature sets, similarity metrics, and models—that can confirm, disconfirm, or refine Jungian claims rather than merely interpret them.

**4. Rational Mysticism (Data and Meaning)**
- All claims are defended in terms of observable distributions, effect sizes, and structural regularities, even when the ultimate mechanism remains unknown.  
- The stance is “information realist but mechanism-agnostic”: synchronicities are treated as possible signatures of a deeper informational order, while maintaining strict discipline about what the data actually justifies.

## The Compact "Elevator" Version

Symbolic Empiricism is a research program that uses geometric and computational models to test whether traditional symbolic systems carry real, reusable information about human experience. It is consciously “not astrology”: no fate, no metaphysical guarantees—only hypotheses about resonance, evaluated with the same skepticism and methodological care brought to any other noisy, high-dimensional dataset.

## Positioning Angles

**1. The Anti-Dread App**
- **Primary Value:** Replaces vague, formless anxiety with specific, definable pressure points ("pain with coordinates").
- **Goal:** Enable users to face fears by naming them.
- **Tagline:** "Your map for what's coming. Not so you can fear it, but so you can name it."

**2. The Compass for Life Transitions**
- **Primary Value:** A framework for navigating life's messiest parts (divorce, career shifts, health crises).
- **Goal:** Provide context and structure during radical change.
- **Tagline:** "Maps for the messiest parts of the human story."

**3. The Narrative Engine**
- **Primary Value:** A symbolic research and ideation tool for creative professionals.
- **Target Audience:** Writers, filmmakers, artists, historians.
- **Tagline:** "The underlying code of human experience."

## Overarching Philosophy: Jung meets Popper
The system's commitment is to falsifiability. It acknowledges when a pattern does not resonate ("Outside Symbolic Range" or "OSR") as the primary antidote to the stigma often associated with symbolic systems.
