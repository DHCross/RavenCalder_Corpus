 * THE WOVEN MAP STRESS-TEST: AUDIT & NOVEMBER PROTOCOL
 * 
 * This document details the rigorous stress-test of the Woven Map's collective impact model
 * (Crisis Detection) and the pre-registered protocol for the live November 2025 test.
 * 
 * Key Stats:
 * - Historical Hit Rate: High (Michael, Opal, Ivan, Dennis identified).
 * - Placebo False Positives: Zero (Quiet months passed).
 * - Localization Ratio (R): ~1.93 (PC Signal ~2x stronger than MD during storms).

# THE WOVEN MAP STRESS-TEST: AUDIT & NOVEMBER PROTOCOL

**Executive Summary (BLUF)**
*   **Validity:** Model detects localized, collective crisis signatures with repeatable accuracy (not just an N=1 Michael fluke).
*   **Specificity:** Signal is geographically specific (PC > MD during storms).
*   **Next Step:** November 2025 is a clean, pre-registered, out-of-sample test.

## Part 1: What the Stress-Test Established
1.  **Not N=1:** Michael, Opal, Ivan, Dennis registered as "hits"; five quiet "placebo" months didn't.
2.  **Not Selection Bias:** A 50-person *random* Panama City cohort spiked similarly to the family cohort during events (96th-98th percentile).
3.  **True Localization:** PC Intensity ≈ 1.93x MD Intensity during storms (R ≈ 1.93). During quiet months, R ≈ 1.09 (no difference).
4.  **No Fudge Factor:** Fixed formula for distance/relocation held up.

## Part 2: The Audit Data (Proof of Work)

### The "When" Data (Time)
*   **Hits:** Michael (2018), Dennis (2005), Eloise (1975), Erin (1995), Georges (1998), Opal (1995), Ivan (2004).
*   **Placebos (Quiet):** Jan '95, Feb '04, Jan '05, Feb '10, Mar '99, Apr '08, May '11.

### The "Who" Data (Cohorts)
*   **PC Cohort:** Daniel, Abby, Elizabeth, Richard, Stephanie, Tavaris.
*   **MD Control:** Carrie, Aidan, Emey + 5 Controls.
*   **Random PC:** 50 anonymized local births (decades 60s-10s).

## Part 3: Live Validation Protocol (The "November Standard")
**This is the generalized rigorous testing standard, established for the live November 2025 confirmatory experiment.**

### Triggers (Event Window)
*   **Official Warning:** NHC Hurricane Warning (or equivalent local crisis alert).
*   **Proximity:** Landfall < 125mi of location.
*   **Intensity:** Winds >= 64kt (or localized equivalent).

### Quantitative Criteria (The Standard)
1.  **Primary Hit (Person):** Intensity ≥ **3.5** AND Valence ≤ **-2.0** (±24h of peak).
2.  **Collective Hit (Group):** ≥ **65%** of in-zone subjects meet Primary Hit.
3.  **Localization Ratio (R):** meanIntensity(ImpactZone) / meanIntensity(ControlZone). Expect **R ≥ 1.5** (Signal is 50% stronger in zone).

## Part 4: Practical Readiness
*   **Household:** Meds list/packs, power banks, inverter, documents (PDF/Zip), evacuation triggers (Surge ≥3ft or Winds ≥50kt).
*   **Comms:** Single text thread (PC + MD), pre-agreed check-ins (7a/1p/7p).

## Limitations
*   Symbolic detection, not meteorological. Mapping *pressure*, not wind speed.
*   Prospective validity rests entirely on the November performance.
