# IMPACT DEFINITION PROTOCOL

**Core Law:** Impact is **Symbolic Pressure**, not a predetermined **Event**.

This document outlines how "impact" is defined and managed in symbolic interpretation.

---

## 1. Impact as Symbolic Pressure

- **Rule:** Transit interpretations are framed as **symbolic pressure** or **resonance windows**, never as predetermined events or outcomes.
- **Prohibition:** Deterministic or fate-based language is strictly prohibited.
- **Framing:** "Impact" is a potential/pressure window, not something that "happens to" a person.

## 2. Resonance Status: Pending Until Confirmation

- **Rule:** Resonance status remains **"Pending"** until the user confirms an experiential match.
- **Constraint:** Even with perfect geometry, "impact" cannot be declared until the user pings (confirms) it in lived experience.
- **Data Flow:** \`ping_logging_requires_user_confirmation: true\`.

## 3. Geometry-First, Experience-Second

- **Rule:** Every transit must pass strict geometry verification before inclusion.
- **Nuance:** Verified geometry is **NOT** proof of impact; it is only a "pressure window."
- **Language Mode:** Conditional, non-predictive, diagnostic only.

## 4. Heat Map & Atmospheric Framing

- **Rule:** When no major transits are active, output must describe the **"atmospheric quality,"** never stating "no impact."
- **Prohibited Phrases:** "No significant transits," "No impact," "Nothing happening."
- **Approved Phrasing:**
  - "Atmospheric pressure registers low on the symbolic heat map."
  - "Current symbolic pressure: low, offering a preparatory atmosphere."
  - "Heat Map 0: active baseline symbolic activation."

## 5. Testable & Agency-Preserving Language

- **Rule:** All reflections must use emotionally clear, **testable language** that translates symbolic geometry into lived experience.
- **Constraint:** "Impact" is never assumed; it is always an invitation for the user to notice or reject.
- **Voice:** Plainspoken, observation-based, non-causal.

## 6. YAML Structure: Impact as Status

- **Status Field:** \`Resonance_Status\` must be logged as \`Pending\`, \`Confirmed\`, or \`OSR\` (Outside Symbolic Range).
- **Logic:** "Impact" is only logged as \`Confirmed\` if the user reports it.

## 7. Mirror Flow & Socratic Prompts

- **Rule:** Mirror summaries and prompts must **invite reflection**, never assert occurrence.
- **Structure:** Hook Stack (Resonance) → Paradox → Testable Voice Summary.

## 8. Prohibitions & Enforcement

- **Strictly Prohibited:**
  - "No impact" / "Nothing happening"
  - Causal/Fate-based language ("This will cause...")
  - Summaries of impact not grounded in user confirmation
- **Penalty:** Regeneration of output if violated.

**Summary Table:**

| Protocol Area | Impact Handling Rule |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Symbolic Pressure** | Output = pressure window, not event/outcome |
| **Resonance Status** | "Pending" until user confirms |
| **Geometry** | Required for inclusion, not proof of impact |
| **Atmospheric Framing** | Always describe energetic field; never "no impact" |
| **Language Mode** | Conditional, non-predictive, testable |
| **Enforcement** | Prohibits binary/deterministic language |
