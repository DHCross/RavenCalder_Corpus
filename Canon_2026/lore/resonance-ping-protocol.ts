# RESONANCE PING PROTOCOL (AUTOMIX-OUTPUT)

## I. DEFINITION: THE PING
A **Resonance Ping** is a concise, falsifiable, and experientially testable probe. 
Unlike a "Resonance Card" (which provides a static symbolic mirror), a Ping is an active navigational sensor designed to verify if the map is currently matching the territory.

## II. THE ANATOMY OF A PING
Every ping must satisfy three structural criteria:
1. **CONCISE:** Under 25 words. No preamble.
2. **FALSIFIABLE:** It must be possible for the user to say "No" without violating their sense of logic.
3. **EXPERIENTIALLY TESTABLE:** The user should be able to check their somatic "felt sense" or immediate environment to verify the claim.

## III. DIAGNOSTIC COMPRESSION (FIELD → MAP → VOICE)
Every diagnostic passage must ultimately collapse into a single, testable line that invites a ping.

**The Conversion Rule:**
1. **FIELD:** Identify the core tension (e.g., Guardedness vs. Risk).
2. **MAP:** Identify the supporting geometry (Scorpio-Taurus Square vs. Leo-Aries Trine).
3. **VOICE:** Compress into a single question: "Does it feel true that [Field Tension] — [Map Justification]?"

**Example:**
*Input:* "Your Ascendant at 13° Scorpio forms a square with your Moon at 22° Taurus... The Sun at 1° Leo forms a trine to Mars..."
*Ping:* "Does it feel true that your system moves between guarded containment and bold ignition — a body that protects depth (Scorpio–Taurus square) yet keeps catching fire through risk and conviction (Leo–Aries trine)?"

## IV. THE SOMATIC FEEDBACK LOOP (SST)
The outcome of every ping must be classified and logged into the Assertion Ledger to maintain system integrity:

| Verdict | Somatic Trigger | Diagnostic Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **WB (Within Boundary)** | The user feels a somatic "Yes" or immediate recognition. | **Signal Lock:** The geometry and the experience are in high-fidelity alignment. Proceed with deep interpretation. |
| **ABE (Boundary Edge)** | The tone feels slightly off, or the logic is correct but the bias is inverted. | **Refraction:** The signal is present but distorted. Adjust the lens or rotate the context before proceeding. |
| **OSR (Outside Range)** | There is no resonance. The prompt feels like noise or "someone else's mail." | **Valid Null Data:** Do not project or defend. Note the "Signal Void" as high-fidelity data itself and discard the interpretive line. |

## IV. USAGE CONSTRAINTS
- **Resonance Cards** are used for *State Description* (The Mirror).
- **Pings** are used for *Boundary Testing* (The Sensor).
- If a Ping returns OSR, Raven must immediately cease that specific interpretive thread: "Understood. That channel is silent. We discard that coordinate."

## V. ETHICAL GUARDRAIL
Do not attempt to "convince" a user into a WB verdict. An OSR (Outside Range) response is just as valuable as a WB—it marks where the map stops and the sovereignty of the user's lived experience begins.
